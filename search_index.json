Ambassador?\nAmbassador is an open source, Kubernetes-native microservices API gateway built on the Envoy Proxy. Ambassador is built from the ground up to support multiple, independent teams that need to rapidly publish, monitor, and update services for end users. Ambassador can also be used to handle the functions of a Kubernetes ingress controller and load balancer (for more, see this blog post).\nAmbassador is:\n\nSelf-service. Ambassador is designed so that developers can manage services directly. This requires a system that is not only easy for developers to use, but provides safety and protection against inadvertent operational issues.\nOperations friendly. Ambassador has virtually no moving parts, and delegates all routing and resilience to Envoy Proxy and Kubernetes, respectively. Ambassador stores all state in Kubernetes (no database!). Multiple Ambassadors can be run in the same cluster, making upgrades easy and seamless.\nDesigned for microservices. Ambassador integrates the features teams need for microservices, including authentication, rate limiting, observability, routing, TLS termination, and more.\n\nFor more background on the motivations of Ambassador, read this blog post.\nAlternatives to Ambassador\nAlternatives to Ambassador fall in three basic categories.\n\nHosted API gateways, such as the Amazon API gateway.\nTraditional API gateways, such as Kong.\nL7 proxies, such as Traefik, NGINX, HAProxy, or Envoy, or Ingress controllers built on these proxies.\n\nBoth hosted API gateways and traditional API gateways are:\n\nNot self-service. The management interfaces on traditional API gateways are not designed for developer self-service, and provide limited safety and usability for developers.\nNot Kubernetes-native. They're typically configured using REST APIs, making it challenging to adopt cloud-native patterns such as GitOps and declarative configuration.\nDesigned for API management, versus microservices.\n\nA Layer 7 proxy can be used as an API gateway, but typically requires additional bespoke development to support microservices use cases. In fact, many API gateways package the additional features needed for an API gateway on top of a L7 proxy. Ambassador uses Envoy, while Kong uses NGINX. If you're interested in deploying Envoy directly, we've written an introductory tutorial.\nIstio\nIstio is an open source service mesh, built on Envoy. A service mesh is designed to manage east/west traffic, while an API gateway manages north/south traffic. Documentation on how to deploy Ambassador with Istio is here. In general, we've found that north/south traffic is quite different from east/west traffic (i.e., you don't control the client in the North/South use case).\n\n  {\n    \"@context\": \"http://schema.org/\",\n    \"@type\": \"SoftwareApplication\",\n    \"name\": \"Ambassador API Gateway\",\n    \"description\": \"Ambassador, open source, Kubernetes-native API Gateway for microservices built on the Envoy Proxy.\",\n    \"applicationCategory\": \"Cloud Software\",\n    \"applicationSubCategory\": \"API Gateway\",\n    \"operatingSystem\": \"Kubernetes 1.6 or later\"\n    \"downloadUrl\": \"https://www.getambassador.io/\",\n    \"author\": \"Datawire\",\n    \"version\": \"0.39\",\n    \"offers\": {\n      \"@type\": \"Offer\",\n      \"priceCurrency\": \"USD\",\n      \"price\": \"0.00\"\n    }\n  }\n"},"about/features-and-benefits.html":{"url":"about/features-and-benefits.html","title":"Features and Benefits","keywords":"","body":"Features and Benefits\nIn cloud-native organizations, developers frequently take on responsibility for the full development lifecycle of a service, from development to QA to operations. Ambassador was especially designed for these organizations where developers have operational responsibility for their service(s).\nAs such, Ambassador is designed to be used by both developers and operators.\nDevelopers\nFor developers, Ambassador:\n\nEnables publishing a service publicly without operational help\nFine-grained control of routing, with support for regex-based routing, host routing, and more\nAuthentication\nSupport for gRPC and HTTP/2\nCanary releases\nShadow traffic\nTransparent monitoring of L7 traffic to given services\n\nOperators\nFor operators, Ambassador:\n\nIs simple to deploy and operate, relying entirely on Envoy and Kubernetes for routing and scaling\nHas extensive support for TLS termination and redirects\nIntegrated diagnostics for troubleshooting\nSupports running multiple Ambassadors in a cluster, with different versions, simplifying upgrades and testing\nIntegrates with Istio, if you need a service mesh\n\nDetails\nMore details about some of the features of Ambassador are discussed below.\nSelf-Service via Kubernetes Annotations\nAmbassador is built from the start to support self-service deployments -- a developer working on a new service doesn't have to go to Operations to get their service added to the mesh, they can do it themselves in a matter of seconds. Likewise, a developer can remove their service from the mesh, or merge services, or separate services, as needed, at their convenience. All of these operations are performed via Kubernetes annotations, so it can easily integrate with your existing development workflow.\nFlexible Canary Deployments\nCanary deployments are an essential component of cloud-native development workflows. In a canary deployment, a small percentage of production traffic is routed to a new version of a service to test it under real-world conditions. Ambassador allows developers to easily control and manage the amount of traffic routed to a given service through annotations. This tutorial covers a complete canary workflow using Ambassador.\nKubernetes-Native Architecture\nAmbassador relies entirely on Kubernetes for reliability, availability, and scalability. For example, Ambassador persists all state in Kubernetes, instead of requiring a separate database. Scaling Ambassador is as simple as changing the replicas in your deployment, or using a horizontal pod autoscaler.\nAmbassador uses Envoy for all traffic routing and proxying. Envoy is a modern L7 proxy that is used in production at companies including Lyft, Apple, Google, and Stripe.\ngRPC and HTTP/2 Support\nAmbassador fully supports gRPC and HTTP/2 routing, thanks to Envoy's extensive capabilities in this area. See gRPC and Ambassador for more information.\nIstio Integration\nAmbassador integrates with the Istio service mesh as the edge proxy. In this configuration, Ambassador routes external traffic to the internal Istio service mesh. See Istio and Ambassador for details.\nAuthentication\nAmbassador supports authenticating incoming requests. When configured, Ambassador will check with a third party authentication service prior to routing an incoming request. For more information, see the authentication tutorial.\nRate Limiting\nAmbassador supports rate limiting incoming requests. When configured, Ambassador will check with a third party rate limit service prior to routing an incoming request. For more information, see the rate limiting tutorial.\nIntegrated Diagnostics\nAmbassador includes a diagnostics service so that you can quickly debug issues associated with configuring Ambassador. For more information, see running Ambassador.\n"},"user-guide/install.html":{"url":"user-guide/install.html","title":"Installing Ambassador","keywords":"","body":"Installing Ambassador\nAmbassador can be installed in a variety of ways.

Ambassador provides all the functionality of a traditional ingress controller (i.e., path-based routing) while exposing many additional capabilities such as authentication, URL rewriting, CORS, rate limiting, and automatic metrics collection (the mappings reference contains a full list of supported options). For more background on Kubernetes ingress, read this blog post.\nAmbassador is designed to allow service authors to control how their service is published to the Internet. We accomplish this by permitting a wide range of annotations on the service, which Ambassador reads to configure its Envoy Proxy. Below, we'll use service annotations to configure Ambassador to map /httpbin/ to httpbin.org.\n1. Deploying Ambassador\nTo deploy Ambassador in your default namespace, first you need to check if Kubernetes has RBAC enabled:\nkubectl cluster-info dump --namespace kube-system | grep authorization-mode\n\nIf you see something like --authorization-mode=Node,RBAC in the output, then RBAC is enabled. The majority of current hosted Kubernetes providers (such as GKE) create\nclusters with RBAC enabled by default, and unfortunately the above command may not return any information indicating this.\nNote: If you're using Google Kubernetes Engine with RBAC, you'll need to grant permissions to the account that will be setting up Ambassador. To do this, get your official GKE username, and then grant cluster-admin role privileges to that username:\n$ kubectl create clusterrolebinding my-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=$(gcloud info --format=\"value(config.account)\")\nIf RBAC is enabled:\nkubectl apply -f https://getambassador.io/yaml/ambassador/ambassador-rbac.yaml\n\nWithout RBAC, you can use:\nkubectl apply -f https://getambassador.io/yaml/ambassador/ambassador-no-rbac.yaml\n\nWe recommend downloading the YAML files and exploring the content. You will see\nthat an ambassador-admin NodePort Service is created (which provides an\nAmbassador Diagnostic web UI), along with an ambassador ClusterRole, ServiceAccount and ClusterRoleBinding (if RBAC is enabled). An Ambassador Deployment is also created.\nFor production configurations, we recommend you download these YAML files as your starting point, and customize them accordingly (e.g., your namespace).\n2. Defining the Ambassador Service\nAmbassador is deployed as a Kubernetes Service that references the ambassador\nDeployment you deployed previously. Create the following YAML and put it in a file called ambassador-service.yaml.\n---\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: ambassador\nspec:\n  type: LoadBalancer\n  ports:\n   - port: 80\n  selector:\n    service: ambassador\n\nDeploy this service with kubectl:\n$ kubectl apply -f ambassador-service.yaml\n\nThe YAML above creates a Kubernetes service for Ambassador of type LoadBalancer. All HTTP traffic will be evaluated against the routing rules you create. Note that if you're not deploying in an environment where LoadBalancer is a supported type (such as minikube), you'll need to change this to a different type of service, e.g., NodePort.\n3. Creating your first route\nCreate the following YAML and put it in a file called httpbin.yaml.\n---\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: httpbin\n  annotations:\n    getambassador.io/config: |\n      ---\n      apiVersion: ambassador/v0\n      kind:  Mapping\n      name:  httpbin_mapping\n      prefix: /httpbin/\n      service: httpbin.org:80\n      host_rewrite: httpbin.org\nspec:\n  ports:\n  - name: httpbin\n    port: 80\n\nThen, apply it to the Kubernetes with kubectl:\n$ kubectl apply -f httpbin.yaml\n\nWhen the service is deployed, Ambassador will notice the getambassador.io/config annotation on the service, and use the Mapping contained in it to configure the route.  (There's no restriction on what kinds of Ambassador configuration can go into the annotation, but it's important to note that Ambassador only looks at annotations on Kubernetes Services.)\nIn this case, the mapping creates a route that will route traffic from the /httpbin/ endpoint to the public httpbin.org service. Note that we are using the host_rewrite attribute for the httpbin_mapping â€” this forces the HTTP Host header, and is often a good idea when mapping to external services. Ambassador supports many different configuration options.\n4. Testing the Mapping\nTo test things out, we'll need the external IP for Ambassador (it might take some time for this to be available):\nkubectl get svc -o wide ambassador\n\nEventually, this should give you something like:\nNAME         CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)        AGE\nambassador   10.11.12.13     35.36.37.38     80:31656/TCP   1m\nYou should now be able to use curl to httpbin (don't forget the trailing /):\n$ curl 35.36.37.38/httpbin/\n\nor on minikube:\n$ minikube service list\n|-------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|\n|  NAMESPACE  |         NAME         |             URL             |\n|-------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|\n| default     | ambassador-admin     | http://192.168.99.107:30319 |\n| default     | ambassador           | http://192.168.99.107:31893 |\n|-------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|\n$ curl http://192.168.99.107:31893/httpbin/\n\nor on Docker for Mac/Windows\n$ kubectl get svc\nNAME               TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE\nambassador         LoadBalancer   10.106.108.64    localhost     80:32324/TCP     13m\nambassador-admin   NodePort       10.107.188.149           8877:30993/TCP   14m\nhttpbin            ClusterIP      10.107.77.153            80/TCP           13m\nkubernetes         ClusterIP      10.96.0.1                443/TCP          84d\n$ curl http://localhost/httpbin/\n\n5. Adding a Service\nYou can add a Service route simply by deploying it with an appropriate Ambassador annotation. For example, we can deploy the QoTM service locally in this cluster, and automatically map it through Ambassador by creating qotm.yaml with the following configuration:\n---\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: qotm\n  annotations:\n    getambassador.io/config: |\n      ---\n      apiVersion: ambassador/v0\n      kind:  Mapping\n      name:  qotm_mapping\n      prefix: /qotm/\n      service: qotm\nspec:\n  selector:\n    app: qotm\n  ports:\n  - port: 80\n    name: http-qotm\n    targetPort: http-api\n---\napiVersion: extensions/v1beta1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: qotm\nspec:\n  replicas: 1\n  strategy:\n    type: RollingUpdate\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: qotm\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - name: qotm\n        image: datawire/qotm:1.1\n        ports:\n        - name: http-api\n          containerPort: 5000\n        resources:\n          limits:\n            cpu: \"0.1\"\n            memory: 100Mi\n\nand then applying it with:\nkubectl apply -f qotm.yaml\nA few seconds after the QoTM service is running, Ambassador should be configured for it. Try it with\n$ curl http://${AMBASSADOR_IP}/qotm/\n\n6. The Diagnostics Service in Kubernetes\nAmbassador includes an integrated diagnostics service to help with troubleshooting. By default, this is not exposed to the Internet. To view it, we'll need to get the name of one of the Ambassador pods:\n$ kubectl get pods\nNAME                          READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\nambassador-3655608000-43x86   1/1       Running   0          2m\nambassador-3655608000-w63zf   1/1       Running   0          2m\nForwarding local port 8877 to one of the pods:\nkubectl port-forward ambassador-3655608000-43x86 8877\nwill then let us view the diagnostics at http://localhost:8877/ambassador/v0/diag/.\n7.

In the next section, we'll then walk through how to deploy Ambassador in Kubernetes with a custom configuration.\n1. Running the Demo Configuration\nBy default, Ambassador uses a demo configuration to show some of its basic features. Get it running with Docker, and expose Ambassador on port 8080:\ndocker run -it -p 8080:80 --name=ambassador --rm quay.io/datawire/ambassador:{VERSION} --demo\n\n2. Ambassador's Diagnostics\nAmbassador provides live diagnostics viewable with a web browser. While this would normally not be exposed to the public network, the Docker demo publishes the diagnostics service at the following URL:\nhttp://localhost:8080/ambassador/v0/diag/\nSome of the most important information - your Ambassador version, how recently Ambassador's configuration was updated, and how recently Envoy last reported status to Ambassador - is right at the top. The diagnostics overview can show you what it sees in your configuration map, and which Envoy objects were created based on your configuration.\n3. The Quote of the Moment Service\nSince Ambassador is an API gateway, its primary purpose is to provide access to microservices. The demo is preconfigured with a mapping that connects the /qotm/ resource to the \"Quote of the Moment\" service -- a demo service that supplies quotations. You can try it out here:\ncurl http://localhost:8080/qotm/\n\nThis request will route to the qotm service at demo.getambassador.io, and return a quote in a JSON object.\nYou can also see the mapping by clicking the mapping-qotm.yaml link from the diagnostic overview, or by opening\nhttp://localhost:8080/ambassador/v0/diag/mapping-qotm.yaml\n4. Authentication\nOn the diagnostic overview, you can also see that Ambassador is configured to do authentication -- click the auth.yaml link, or open\nhttp://localhost:8080/ambassador/v0/diag/auth.yaml\nfor more here. Ambassador uses a demo authentication service at demo.getambassador.io to mediate access to the Quote of the Moment: simply getting a random quote is allowed without authentication, but to get a specific quote, you'll have to authenticate:\ncurl -v http://localhost:8080/qotm/quote/5\n\nwill return a 401, but\ncurl -v -u username:password http://localhost:8080/qotm/quote/5\n\nwill succeed. (Note that that's literally \"username\" and \"password\" -- the demo auth service is deliberately not very secure!)\nNote that it's up to the auth service to decide what needs authentication -- teaming Ambassador with an authentication service can be as flexible or strict as you need it to be.\nNext steps\nWe've just walked through some of the core features of Ambassador in a local configuration. Next, we'll walk through how to configure these features in Kubernetes.\n"},"user-guide/docker-compose.html":{"url":"user-guide/docker-compose.html","title":"Docker Compose","keywords":"","body":"Deploying Ambassador to Docker Compose for local development\nDocker Compose is useful for local development where Minikube may be undesirable. This guide is not intended for production deployments but it is intended to allow developers to quickly try out Ambassador features in a simple, local environment.\nIt is important to note that any change to Ambassador's configuration using this method requires a restart of the Ambassador container and thus downtime.\nPrerequisites\nWe assume that you have the latest version of Docker at the time of the writing of this guide.\n1. Creating a simple Docker Compose environment\nIn this guide we will begin with a basic Ambassador API Gateway and add features over time. Not all features will be covered but by the end of this read you should know how to configure Ambassador to meet your local development needs.\nCreate docker-compose.yaml file\nIn a working directory create a file called docker-compose.yaml with this content:\nversion: '3.5'\n\nservices:\n  ambassador:\n    image: quay.io/datawire/ambassador:0.38.0\n    ports:\n    # expose port 80 via 8080 on the host machine\n    - 8080:80\n    volumes:\n    # mount a volume where we can inject configuration files\n    - ./config:/ambassador/ambassador-config\n\nNote the mounted volume. When Ambassador bootstraps on container startup it checks the /ambassador/ambassador-config directory for configuration files. We will use this behavior to configure ambassador.\nTest using Ambassador's Diagnostics\nRun your compose environment and curl the diagnostics endpoint to ensure the compose file is working as expected.\n# start your containers in the background\ndocker-compose up -d\n\n# curl for the response header from the diagnostics endpoint\ncurl -I localhost:8080/ambassador/v0/diag/\n\n# the response code should be 200\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nserver: envoy\ndate: Fri, 17 Aug 2018 21:07:37 GMT\ncontent-type: text/html; charset=utf-8\ncontent-length: 6459\nx-envoy-upstream-service-time: 10\n\n2. Make a change to the default configuration\nLet's turn off the diagnostics page to demonstrate how we will enable and configure Ambassador.\nCreate a config folder (which must match the mounted volume in the docker-compose.yaml file) and add a file called ambassador.yaml to the directory.\n(Note: Configuration files can have any name or combined into the same yaml file)\nmkdir config\ntouch config/ambassador.yaml\n\nSet the contents of the config/ambassador.yaml to this yaml configuration:\n---\napiVersion: ambassador/v0\nkind: Module\nname: ambassador\nconfig:\n  diagnostics:\n    # Stop the diagnostics endpoint from being publicly available\n    enabled: false\n\nNow restart ambassador and test the diagnostics endpoint to ensure our configuration is in use:\n# restart the container to pick up new configuration settings\ndocker-compose up -d -V ambassador\n\n# curl the same diagnostics endpoint as the previous step\ncurl -I localhost:8080/ambassador/v0/diag/\n\n# the response code should be 404\nHTTP/1.1 404 Not Found\ndate: Fri, 17 Aug 2018 21:18:25 GMT\nserver: envoy\ncontent-length: 0\n\nFeel free to re-enable the diagnostics endpoint.\n3. Add a route mapping\nNow that we have demonstrated that we can modify the configuration let's add a mapping to route to http://demo.getambassador.io/qotm/ service.\nCreate a new file config/mapping-qotm.yaml with these contents:\n---\napiVersion: ambassador/v0\nkind:  Mapping\nname:  qotm_mapping\nprefix: /qotm/\nrewrite: /qotm/\nservice: demo.getambassador.io\n\nOnce again, restart ambassador and test the new mapping:\n# restart the container to pick up new configuration settings\ndocker-compose up -d -V ambassador\n\n# curl the quote-of-the-moment service\ncurl localhost:8080/qotm/quote/1\n\n# the response body should be a json object with a quote\n{\n  \"hostname\": \"qotm-3716059461-47tnl\",\n  \"ok\": true,\n  \"quote\": \"The light at the end of the tunnel is interdependent on the relatedness of motivation, subcultures, and management.\",\n  \"time\": \"2018-08-17T21:29:24.690950\",\n  \"version\": \"1.3\"\n}\n\n3. Add a route mapping to an internal service\nWhile routing to an external service is useful, more often than not our Docker Compose environment will contain a number of services that need routing.\nAdd the qotm service to the docker-compose.yaml file\nEdit the docker-compose.yaml file and add a new qotm service. It should now look like this:\nversion: '3.5'\n\nservices:\n  ambassador:\n    image: quay.io/datawire/ambassador:0.38.0\n    ports:\n    - 8080:80\n    volumes:\n    # mount a volume where we can inject configuration files\n    - ./config:/ambassador/ambassador-config\n  qotm:\n    image: datawire/qotm:1.3\n    ports:\n    - 5000\n\nUpdate the mapping-qotm.yaml file to route to our internal qotm service\nEdit the config/mapping-qotm.yaml file and modify the service and rewrite field. It should now look like this:\n---\napiVersion: ambassador/v0\nkind:  Mapping\nname:  qotm_mapping\nprefix: /qotm/\n# remove the qotm prefix when talking to the qotm service\nrewrite: /\n# change the `service` parameter to the name of our service with the port\nservice: qotm:5000\n\nRestart Ambassador and test\nRe-run the same test as in the previous section to ensure the route works as before. This time we will need to bring up the new service first.\n# start all new containers (eg. qotm)\ndocker-compose up -d\n\n# restart the container to pick up new configuration settings\ndocker-compose up -d -V ambassador\n\n# curl the quote-of-the-moment service\ncurl localhost:8080/qotm/quote/1\n\n# the response body should be a json object with a quote\n{\n  \"hostname\": \"qotm-3716059461-47tnl\",\n  \"ok\": true,\n  \"quote\": \"The light at the end of the tunnel is interdependent on the relatedness of motivation, subcultures, and management.\",\n  \"time\": \"2018-08-17T21:29:24.690950\",\n  \"version\": \"1.3\"\n}\n\nVerify that the local qotm container is serving requests\nTo ensure that the routing changes worked inspect the docker-compose logs to see the output from the local qotm service. It should look something like this:\n> docker-compose logs\nAttaching to ambassador-compose_qotm_1\nqotm_1        | 2018-08-17 21:53:13 QotM 1.3 INFO: initializing on local-qotm:5000\nqotm_1        | 2018-08-17 21:53:13 QotM 1.3 INFO:  * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)\nqotm_1        | 2018-08-17 21:53:13 QotM 1.3 INFO:  * Restarting with stat\nqotm_1        | 2018-08-17 21:53:14 QotM 1.3 INFO: initializing on local-qotm:5000\nqotm_1        | 2018-08-17 21:53:14 QotM 1.3 WARNING:  * Debugger is active!\nqotm_1        | 2018-08-17 21:53:14 QotM 1.3 INFO:  * Debugger PIN: 336-275-311\nqotm_1        | 2018-08-17 21:53:41 QotM 1.3 DEBUG: GET /: session None, username None, handler statement\nqotm_1        | 2018-08-17 21:53:41 QotM 1.3 INFO: 172.19.0.3 - - [17/Aug/2018 21:53:41] \"GET / HTTP/1.1\" 200 -\n\n4. Add Authentication\nThe authentication module can be used to verify the identity and other security concerns at the entrypoint to the docker-compose cluster.\nWe will use the datawire/ambassador-auth-service container as an example.\nCreate docker-compose.yaml service entry\nUpdate the docker-compose.yaml file to include the new auth service:\nversion: '3.5'\n\nservices:\n  ambassador:\n    image: quay.io/datawire/ambassador:0.38.0\n    ports:\n    - 8080:80\n    volumes:\n    # mount a volume where we can inject configuration files\n    - ./config:/ambassador/ambassador-config\n  qotm:\n    image: datawire/qotm:1.3\n    ports:\n    - 5000\n  auth:\n    image: datawire/ambassador-auth-service:latest\n    ports:\n    - 3000\n\nCreate the auth.yaml configuration\nMake a new file called config/auth.yaml with an auth definition inside:\n---\napiVersion: ambassador/v0\nkind:  AuthService\nname:  authentication\nauth_service: \"auth:3000\"\npath_prefix: \"/extauth\"\nallowed_headers:\n- \"x-qotm-session\"\n\nThis configuration will use the AuthService object to ensure that all requests made to ambassador are first sent to the auth docker container on port 3000 before being routed to the service that is mapped to the desired route. See the Authentication documentation for more details.\nVerify that Authentication is working\nThis sample authentication service only supports basic auth on a specific route. While the route is hardcoded you can implement your own that covers all routes. We will demonstrate that accessing the authenticated route with an incorrect Authorization header will result in a 401.\n# start all new containers (eg. auth)\ndocker-compose up -d\n\n# restart the api gateway to pick up new configuration settings\ndocker-compose up -d -V ambassador\n\n# curl the quote-of-the-moment service without an auth header\ncurl -I localhost:8080/qotm/quote/1\n\n# the response should look like this\nHTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\nx-powered-by: Express\nx-request-id: da059f3e-7b9e-4d98-8428-f4f8ca742af7\nwww-authenticate: Basic realm=\"Ambassador Realm\"\ncontent-type: text/html; charset=utf-8\ncontent-length: 0\netag: W/\"0-2jmj7l5rSw0yVb/vlWAYkK/YBwk\"\ndate: Fri, 17 Aug 2018 22:25:38 GMT\nx-envoy-upstream-service-time: 1\nserver: envoy\n\n# now try with a specific username and password\ncurl -I --user username:password localhost:8080/qotm/quote/1\n\n# the response should be a 200\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\ncontent-type: application/json\nx-qotm-session: 5b75f31f-1155-4827-ab28-74d0f98573da\ncontent-length: 217\nserver: envoy\ndate: Fri, 17 Aug 2018 22:29:43 GMT\nx-envoy-upstream-service-time: 2\n\n5. Tracing\nAs a final example we will configure Ambassador to send Zipkin traces to Jaeger. Integrating Zipkin into your services can be a vital glimpse into the performance bottlenecks of a distributed system.\nAdd the Jaeger container to the docker-compose.yaml file\nBuilding on our original docker-compose.yaml file, we can add a new service called tracing to the list:\nversion: '3.5'\n\nservices:\n  ambassador:\n    image: quay.io/datawire/ambassador:0.38.0\n    ports:\n    - 8080:80\n    volumes:\n    # mount a volume where we can inject configuration files\n    - ./config:/ambassador/ambassador-config\n  qotm:\n    image: datawire/qotm:1.3\n    ports:\n    - 5000\n  auth:\n    image: datawire/ambassador-auth-service:latest\n    ports:\n    - 3000\n  tracing:\n    image: jaegertracing/all-in-one:latest\n    environment:\n      COLLECTOR_ZIPKIN_HTTP_PORT: 9411\n    ports: \n      - 5775:5775/udp\n      - 6831:6831/udp\n      - 6832:6832/udp\n      - 5778:5778\n      - 16686:16686\n      - 14268:14268\n      - 9411:9411\n\nCreate a tracing configuration file for Ambassador\nAdd a new configuration file config/tracing.yaml with these contents:\n---\napiVersion: ambassador/v0\nkind: TracingService\nname: tracing\nservice: tracing:9411\ndriver: zipkin\n\nThis will forward all of Ambassador's traces to the tracing service.\nMake requests and observe the traces\nAfter reloading the Docker containers and configuration we should be able to make requests to the qotm service and see the traces in the Jaeger front-end UI.\n# start all new containers (eg. tracing)\ndocker-compose up -d\n\n# restart the api gateway to pick up new configuration settings\ndocker-compose up -d -V ambassador\n\n# curl the quote-of-the-moment service as many times as you would like\ncurl --user username:password localhost:8080/qotm/quote/1\n\nIn a browser you can go to http://localhost:16686/ and search for traces. To make this demonstration more useful one should implement Zipkin tracing middleware into their webserver.\nNext Steps\nWe have demonstrated that all the configurations that would normally be stored in kubernetes annotations can be saved as a yaml document in a volume mapped to /ambassador/ambassador-config within the Ambassador docker container. Hopefully this guide can be used to test new configurations locally before moving to a Kubernetes cluster. Of course, there will be differences between docker-compose and the Kubernetes implementation and one should be sure to test thoroughly in the latter before moving to production.\n"},"concepts/developers.html":{"url":"concepts/developers.html","title":"Decentralized configuration","keywords":"","body":"Ambassador for Developers\nTraditionally, API Gateways have focused on operators as the primary user. Ambassador considers both developers and operators to be first-class citizens.\nDecentralized, declarative configuration\nThe Ambassador model is a decentralized, declarative configuration model. What does this mean?\n\nDecentralized. Ambassador is designed so that lots of developers can individually configure a specific aspect of Ambassador's configuration (usually a route). Ambassador then aggregates these individual bits of configuration into a master configuration for the gateway.\n\nDeclarative. In Ambassador, the user declares the desired end state of the configuration. Ambassador then figures out how to achieve that desired end state. If the desired end state is already in effect, no change happens. This is a contrast from an imperative model (most frequently seen as a REST API configuration), which forces the user to understand how to configure the gateway.\n\n\nAmbassador configuration in practice\nIn a typical Ambassador deployment, each service is owned by a developer or development team. This team writes the code, tests, and deploys the service. In order to deploy this service, a team must create a Kubernetes manifest that specifies the desired end state of the service. For example, the my-service service could be defined as below:\nkind: Service\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n  name: my-service\nspec:\n  selector:\n    app: MyApp\n  ports:\n  - protocol: TCP\n    port: 80\n    targetPort: 9376\nBecause a Kubernetes service is the fundamental abstraction by which new services are exposed to other services and end users, Ambassador extends the service with custom annotations. For example:\nkind: Service\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n  name: my-service\n  annotations:\n    getambassador.io/config: |\n      ---\n        apiVersion: ambassador/v0\n        kind:  Mapping\n        name:  my_service_mapping\n        prefix: /my-service/\n        service: my-service\nspec:\n  selector:\n    app: MyApp\n  ports:\n  - protocol: TCP\n    port: 80\n    targetPort: 9376\nWith this approach, there is no centralized Ambassador configuration file -- the routing configuration for Ambassador is associated with each individual service. This offers numerous benefits:\n\nAgility: Service owners can change their Ambassador configuration without worrying about other end users or going through a central operations function.\nOrganizational scalability: Configuring individual routes in Ambassador is the responsibility of service owners, instead of a centralized team.\nMaintainability: If a service is deleted, the route disappears with the service. All of the machinery used to manage Kubernetes manifests can be used with Ambassador without modification.\n\nCentralized configuration\nIt's possible as a migration strategy to start with a centralized Ambassador configuration that contains all the necessary mappings (you can create a dummy service for this). In general, though, this approach is not recommended.\nIngress resources\nAstute Kubernetes observers may note that this decentralized model is not unique to Ambassador. In fact, Ingress controllers and Ingress resources can be used in a similar way. In this approach, a Kubernetes service stays unmodified, and a separate Ingress resource can be added to the Kubernetes manifest. You'd end up with something that looks like:\nkind: Service\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n  name: my-service\nspec:\n  selector:\n    app: MyApp\n  ports:\n  - protocol: TCP\n    port: 80\n    targetPort: 9376\n---\napiVersion: extensions/v1beta1\nkind: Ingress\nmetadata:\n  name: my-service-ingress\nspec:\n  backend:\n    serviceName: my-service\n    servicePort: 80\nAmbassador has chosen not to support ingress resources for the following reasons:\n\nThe ingress API is extremely limited, and supports only a small subset of Ambassador's features\nThe ingress API has been in beta for a number of years, and there is the possibility of it being deprecated altogether\nHaving a separate object that is associated with the service object \n\n"},"concepts/architecture.html":{"url":"concepts/architecture.html","title":"Ambassador Architecture","keywords":"","body":"Ambassador Architecture\nAmbassador is a control plane\nAmbassador is a specialized control plane for Envoy Proxy. In this architecture, Ambassador translates configuration (in the form of Kubernetes annotations) to Envoy configuration. All actual traffic is directly handled by the high-performance Envoy Proxy.\n\nDetails\nWhen a user applies a Kubernetes manifest containing Ambassador annotations, the following steps occur:\n\nAmbassador is asynchronously notified by the Kubernetes API of the change.\nAmbassador translates the configuration into an abstract intermediate representation (IR).\nAn Envoy configuration file is generated from the IR.\nThe Envoy configuration file is validated by Ambassador (using Envoy in validation mode).\nAssuming the file is valid configuration, Ambassador uses Envoy's hot restart mechanism to deploy the new configuration and properly drain connections.\n\nScaling and availability\nAmbassador relies on Kubernetes for scaling, high availability, and persistence. All Ambassador configuration is stored directly in Kubernetes; there is no database. Ambassador is packaged as a single container that contains both the control plane and an Envoy Proxy instance. By default, Ambassador is deployed as a Kubernetes deployment and can be scaled and managed like any other Kubernetes deployment.\nEnvoy Proxy\nAmbassador closely tracks Envoy Proxy releases. A stable branch of Envoy Proxy is maintained that enables the team to cherry pick specific fixes into Ambassador.\n"},"about/microservices-api-gateways.html":{"url":"about/microservices-api-gateways.html","title":"Microservices API Gateways","keywords":"","body":"Microservices API Gateways vs. Traditional Enterprise API Gateways\nA microservices API gateway is an API gateway designed to accelerate the development workflow of independent services teams. A microservices API gateway provides all the functionality for a team to independently publish, monitor, and update a microservice.\nThis focus on accelerating the development workflow is distinct from the purpose of traditional API gateways, which focus on the challenges of managing APIs. Over the past decade, organizations have worked to expose internal systems through well-defined APIs. The challenge of safely exposing hundreds or thousands of APIs to end users (both internal and external) led to the emergence of API gateways. Over time, API gateways have become centralized, mission critical pieces of infrastructure that control access to these APIs.\nIn this article, we'll discuss how the difference in business objective (productivity vs management) results in a very different API gateway.\nMicroservices Organization\nIn a microservices organization, small teams of developers work independently from each other to rapidly deliver functionality to the customer. In order for each service team to work independently, with a productive workflow, a services team needs to be able to:\n\nPublish their service, so that others can use the service\nMonitor their service, to see how well it's working\nTest and update their service, so they can keep on improving the service\n\nThe team needs to all of this without requiring assistance from another operations or platform team--as soon as a services team requires another team, they're no longer working independently, and this can lead to bottlenecks.\nFor service publication, a microservices API gateway provides a static address for consumers, and dynamically route requests to the appropriate service address. In addition, providing authentication and TLS termination for security are typical considerations in exposing a service to other consumers.\nUnderstanding the end user experience of a service is crucial to improving the service. For example, a software update could inadvertently impact the latency of certain requests. A microservices API gateway is well situated to collect key observability metrics on end user traffic as it routes traffic to the end service.\nA microservices API gateway also supports dynamically routing user requests to different service versions for canary testing. By routing a small fraction of end user requests to a new version of a service, service teams can safely test the impact of new updates to a small subset of users.\nMicroservices API Gateways vs. Enterprise API Gateways\nAt first glance, the use case described above may be fulfilled with a enterprise-focused API gateway. While this may be true, the actual emphasis of enterprise API gateways and microservices API gateways are somewhat different:\n\n\n\nUse case\nAPI gateway\nMicroservices API gateway\n\n\n\n\nPrimary Purpose\nExpose, compose, and manage internal business APIs\nExpose and observe internal business services\n\n\nPublishing Functionality\nAPI management team or service team registers / updates gateway via admin API\nService team registers / updates gateway via declarative code as part of the deployment process\n\n\nMonitoring\nAdmin and operations focused e.g. meter API calls per consumer, report errors (e.g. internal 5XX).\nDeveloper focused e.g. latency, traffic, errors, saturation\n\n\nHandling and Debugging Issues\nL7 error-handling (e.g. custom error page or payload). Run gateway/API with additional logging. Troubleshoot issue in staging environment\nConfigure more detailed monitoring. Enable traffic shadowing and / or canarying\n\n\nTesting\nOperate multiple environments for QA, Staging and Production. Automated integration testing, and gated API deployment. Use client-driven API versioning for compatibility and stability (e.g. semver)\nFacilitate canary routing for dynamic testing (taking care with data mutation side effects). Use developer-driven service versioning for upgrade management\n\n\nLocal Development\nDeploy gateway locally (via installation script, Vagrant or Docker), and attempt to mitigate infrastructure differences with production. Use language-specific gateway mocking and stubbing frameworks\nDeploy gateway locally via service orchestration platform (e.g. Kubernetes)\n\n\n\nSelf-Service Publishing\nA team needs to be able to publish a new service to customers without requiring an operations or API management team. This ability to self-service for deployment and publication enables the team to keep the feature release velocity high. While a traditional enterprise API gateway may provide a simple mechanism (e.g., REST API) for publishing a new service, in practice, the usage is often limited to the use of a dedicated team that is responsible for the gateway. The primary reason for limiting publication to a single team is to provide an additional (human) safety mechanism: an errant API call could have potentially disastrous effects on production.\nMicroservices API gateways utilize mechanisms that enable service teams to easily and safely publish new services, with the inherent understanding that the producing team are responsible for their service, and will fix an issue if one occurs. A microservices gateway provides configurable monitoring for issue detection, and provides hooks for debugging, such as inspecting traffic or traffic shifting/duplication.\nMonitoring & Rate Limiting\nA common business model for APIs is metering, where a consumer is charged different fees depending on API usage. Traditional enterprise API gateways excel in this use case: they provide functionality for monitoring per-client usage of an API, and the ability to limit usage when the client exceeds their quota.\nA microservice gateway also requires monitoring and rate limiting, but for different reasons. Monitoring user-visible metrics such as throughput, latency, and availability are important to ensure that new updates don't impact the end user. Robust end user metrics are critical to allowing rapid, incremental updates. Rate limiting is used to improve the overall resilience of a service. When a service is not responding as expected, an API gateway can throttle incoming requests to allow a service to recover and prevent a cascade failure.\nTesting and Updates\nA microservices application has multiple services, each of which is being independently updated. Automated pre-production testing of a moving target is necessary but not sufficient for microservices. Canary testing, where a small percentage of production traffic is routed to a new service version, is an important tool to help test an update. By limiting a new service version to a small percentage of users, the impact of a service failure is limited.\nIn a traditional enterprise API gateway, routing is used to isolate or compose/aggregate changing API versions. Automated pre-production testing and manual post-production verification and exploration is required.\nSummary\nTraditional enterprise API gateways are designed to solve the challenges of API management. While they may appear to solve some of the challenges of adopting microservices, the reality is that a microservices workflow creates a different set of requirements. Integrating a microservices API gateway into your development workflow empowers service teams to self-publish, monitor, and update their service, quickly and safely. This will enable your organization to ship software more rapidly, and with more reliability than ever before.\nFor further reading on how an API Gateway can accelerate continuous delivery, read this blog post.\n"},"concepts/using-ambassador-in-org.html":{"url":"concepts/using-ambassador-in-org.html","title":"Using Ambassador in your organization","keywords":"","body":"Using Ambassador in your organization\nAmbassador can be used in a variety of situations.

In this tutorial, we'll configure Ambassador to use an external third party authentication service.\nBefore You Get Started\nThis tutorial assumes you have already followed the Ambassador Getting Started guide. If you haven't done that already, you should do that now.\nAfter completing Getting Started, you'll have a Kubernetes cluster running Ambassador and the Quote of the Moment service. Let's walk through adding authentication to this setup.\n1. Deploy the authentication service\nAmbassador delegates the actual authentication logic to a third party authentication service. We've written a simple authentication service that:\n\nlistens for requests on port 3000;\nexpects all URLs to begin with /extauth/;\nperforms HTTP Basic Auth for all URLs starting with /qotm/quote/ (other URLs are always permitted);\naccepts only user username, password password; and\nmakes sure that the x-qotm-session header is present, generating a new one if needed.\n\nAmbassador routes all requests through the authentication service: it relies on the auth service to distinguish between requests that need authentication and those that do not. If Ambassador cannot contact the auth service, it will return a 503 for the request; as such, it is very important to have the auth service running before configuring Ambassador to use it.\nHere's the YAML we'll start with:\n---\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: example-auth\nspec:\n  type: ClusterIP\n  selector:\n    app: example-auth\n  ports:\n  - port: 3000\n    name: http-example-auth\n    targetPort: http-api\n---\napiVersion: extensions/v1beta1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: example-auth\nspec:\n  replicas: 1\n  strategy:\n    type: RollingUpdate\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: example-auth\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - name: example-auth\n        image: datawire/ambassador-auth-service:1.1.1\n        imagePullPolicy: Always\n        ports:\n        - name: http-api\n          containerPort: 3000\n        resources:\n          limits:\n            cpu: \"0.1\"\n            memory: 100Mi\n\nNote that the service does not yet contain any Ambassador annotations. This is intentional: we want the service running before we tell Ambassador about it.\nThe YAML above is published at getambassador.io, so if you like, you can just do\nkubectl apply -f https://www.getambassador.io/yaml/demo/demo-auth.yaml\n\nto spin everything up. (Of course, you can also use a local file, if you prefer.)\nWait for the pod to be running before continuing. The output of kubectl get pods should look something like -\n$ kubectl get pods\nNAME                            READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\nexample-auth-6c5855b98d-24clp   1/1       Running   0          4m\n\nNote that the READY field says 1/1 which means the pod is up and running.\n2. Configure Ambassador authentication\nOnce the auth service is running, we need to tell Ambassador about it. The easiest way to do that is to annotate the example-auth service. While we could use kubectl patch for this, it's simpler to just modify the service definition and re-apply. Here's the new YAML:\n---\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: example-auth\n  annotations:\n    getambassador.io/config: |\n      ---\n      apiVersion: ambassador/v0\n      kind:  AuthService\n      name:  authentication\n      auth_service: \"example-auth:3000\"\n      path_prefix: \"/extauth\"\n      allowed_headers:\n      - \"x-qotm-session\"\nspec:\n  type: ClusterIP\n  selector:\n    app: example-auth\n  ports:\n  - port: 3000\n    name: http-example-auth\n    targetPort: http-api\n\nThis configuration tells Ambassador about the auth service, notably that it\nneeds the /extauth prefix, and that it's OK for it to pass back the\nx-qotm-session header. Note that path_prefix and allowed_headers are\noptional.\nIf the auth service uses a framework like\nGorilla Toolkit which enforces strict slashes\nas HTTP path separators, it is possible to end up with an infinite redirect\nwhere the auth service's framework redirects any request with non-conformant\nslashing. This would arise if the above example had\npath_prefix: \"/extauth/\", the auth service would see a request for\n/extauth//qotm/quote/1 which would then be redirected to\n/extauth/quotm/quote/1 rather than actually be handled by the\nauthentication handler. For this reason, remember that the full path of the\nincoming request including the leading slash, will be appended to\npath_prefix regardless of non-conformant slashing.\nYou can apply this file from getambassador.io with\nkubectl apply -f https://www.getambassador.io/yaml/demo/demo-auth-enable.yaml\n\nor, again, apply it from a local file if you prefer.\nAmbassador will see the annotations and reconfigure itself within a few seconds.\n3.

Let's walk through adding rate limiting to this setup.\n1. Deploy the rate limit service\nAmbassador delegates the actual rate limit logic to a third party service. We've written a simple rate limit service that:\n\nlistens for requests on port 5000;\nhandles gRPC shouldRateLimit requests;\nallows requests with the x-ambassador-test-allow: \"true\" header; and\nmarks all other requests as OVER_LIMIT;\n\nHere's the YAML we'll start with:\n---\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: example-rate-limit\n  annotations:\n    getambassador.io/config: |\n      ---\n      apiVersion: ambassador/v0\n      kind: RateLimitService\n      name: ratelimit\n      service: \"example-rate-limit:5000\"\nspec:\n  type: ClusterIP\n  selector:\n    app: example-rate-limit\n  ports:\n  - port: 5000\n    name: http-example-rate-limit\n    targetPort: http-api\n---\napiVersion: extensions/v1beta1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: example-rate-limit\nspec:\n  replicas: 1\n  strategy:\n    type: RollingUpdate\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: example-rate-limit\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - name: example-rate-limit\n        image: agervais/ambassador-ratelimit-service:1.0.0\n        imagePullPolicy: Always\n        ports:\n        - name: http-api\n          containerPort: 5000\n        resources:\n          limits:\n            cpu: \"0.1\"\n            memory: 100Mi\n\nThis configuration tells Ambassador about the rate limit service, notably that it is serving requests at example-rate-limit:5000.\nAmbassador will see the annotations and reconfigure itself within a few seconds.\n2.

If Ambassador cannot contact the rate limit service, it will allow the request to be processed as if there were no rate limit service configuration.\nWe already have the qotm service running, so let's apply some rate limits to the service. The easiest way to do that is to annotate the qotm service. While we could use kubectl patch for this, it's simpler to just modify the service definition and re-apply.

However, if headers are defined, they must be part of the request in order to be rate limited.\nAmbassador would also perform multiple requests to example-rate-limit:5000 if we had defined multiple rate_limits rules on the mapping.\n3.

The trace data will be stored in-memory within the\nZipkin container, and you will be able to explore the traces via the Zipkin\nweb UI.\nFirst, add the following YAML to a file named zipkin.yaml. This configuration\nwill create a zipkin Deployment that uses the openzipkin/zipkin container image\nand also an associated Service. You will notice that the Service also has an\nannotation on it that configures Ambassador to use the zipkin service (running on the\ndefault port of 9411) to provide tracing support.\n---\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: zipkin\n  annotations:\n    getambassador.io/config: |\n      ---\n      apiVersion: ambassador/v0\n      kind: TracingService\n      name: tracing\n      service: zipkin:9411\n      driver: zipkin\nspec:\n  selector:\n    app: zipkin\n  ports:\n  - port: 9411\n    name: http\n    targetPort: http\n  type: NodePort\n---\napiVersion: extensions/v1beta1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: zipkin\nspec:\n  replicas: 1\n  strategy:\n    type: RollingUpdate\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: zipkin\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - name: zipkin\n        image: openzipkin/zipkin\n        imagePullPolicy: Always\n        ports:\n        - name: http\n          containerPort: 9411\n\nYou can deploy this configuration into your Kubernetes cluster like so:\n$ kubectl apply -f zipkin.yaml\n\nThe Ambassador Service will detect the annotations and reconfigure itself within a few seconds.\n2. Generate some requests\nUse curl to generate a few requests to an existing Ambassador mapping. You may need to perform many requests since only a subset of random requests are sampled and instrumented with traces.\n$ curl $AMBASSADOR_IP/httpbin/ip\n\n3. Test traces\nTo test things out, we'll need to access the Zipkin UI. If you're on Kubernetes, get the name of the Zipkin pod:\n$ kubectl get pods\nNAME                                   READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\nambassador-5ffcfc798-c25dc             2/2       Running   0          1d\nprometheus-prometheus-0                2/2       Running   0          113d\nzipkin-868b97667c-58v4r                1/1       Running   0          2h\n\nAnd then use kubectl port-forward to access the pod:\n$ kubectl port-forward zipkin-868b97667c-58v4r 9411\n\nOpen your web browser to http://localhost:9411 for the Zipkin UI.\nIf you're on minikube you can access the NodePort directly, and this ports\nnumber can be obtained via the minikube services list command.\nIf you are using Docker for Mac/Windows, you can use the\nkubectl get svc command to get the same information.\n$ minikube service list\n|-------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|\n|  NAMESPACE  |         NAME         |             URL             |\n|-------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|\n| default     | ambassador-admin     | http://192.168.99.107:30319 |\n| default     | ambassador           | http://192.168.99.107:31893 |\n| default     | zipkin               | http://192.168.99.107:31043 |\n|-------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|\n\nOpen your web browser to the Zipkin dashboard http://192.168.99.107:31043/zipkin/.\nIn the Zipkin UI, click on the \"Find Traces\" button to get a listing instrumented traces. Each of the traces that are displayed can be clicked on, which provides further information\nabout each span and associated metadata.\nMore\nFor more details about configuring the external tracing service, read the documentation on external tracing.\n"},"user-guide/grpc.html":{"url":"user-guide/grpc.html","title":"Use gRPC with Ambassador","keywords":"","body":"gRPC and Ambassador\n\nAmbassador makes it easy to access your services from outside your application. This includes gRPC services, although a little bit of additional configuration is required: by default, Envoy connects to upstream services using HTTP/1.x and then upgrades to HTTP/2 whenever possible. However, gRPC is built on HTTP/2 and most gRPC servers do not speak HTTP/1.x at all. Ambassador must tell its underlying Envoy that your gRPC service only wants to speak that HTTP/2, using the grpc attribute of a Mapping.\nExample\nThis tutorial assumes you have already followed the Ambassador Getting Started guide. If you haven't done that already, you should do that now.\nAfter completing Getting Started, you'll have a Kubernetes cluster running Ambassador and the Quote of the Moment service. Let's walk through adding the Hello World gRPC service for this tutorial. \nMapping gRPC Services\nAmbassador Mappings are based on URL prefixes; for gRPC, the URL prefix is the full service name, including the package path. \nFor Hello World, in its proto definition file, we see\npackage helloworld;\n\nservice Greeter { ... }\nso its URL prefix is helloworld.Greeter, and a reasonable Mapping would be:\n---\napiVersion: ambassador/v0\nkind: Mapping\nname: grpc_mapping\ngrpc: true\nprefix: /helloworld.Greeter/\nrewrite: /helloworld.Greeter/\nservice: grpc-greet\n\nNote the grpc: true line -- this is the necessary magic when mapping a gRPC service. Also note that you'll need prefix and rewrite the same here, since the gRPC service needs the package and service to be in the request to do the right thing.\nDeploying Hello World\nTo deploy and map Hello World, we can use the following YAML:\n---\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  labels:\n    service: grpc-greet\n  name: grpc-greet\n  annotations:\n    getambassador.io/config: |\n      ---\n      apiVersion: ambassador/v0\n      kind: Mapping\n      name: grpc_mapping\n      grpc: true\n      prefix: /helloworld.Greeter/\n      rewrite: /helloworld.Greeter/\n      service: grpc-greet\nspec:\n  type: ClusterIP\n  ports:\n  - port: 80\n    name: grpc-greet\n    targetPort: grpc-api\n  selector:\n    service: grpc-greet\n---\napiVersion: extensions/v1beta1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: grpc-greet\nspec:\n  replicas: 1\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        service: grpc-greet\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - name: grpc-greet\n        image: enm10k/grpc-hello-world\n        ports:\n        - name: grpc-api\n          containerPort: 9999\n        env:\n          - name: PORT\n            value: \"9999\"\n        command:\n          - greeter_server\n      restartPolicy: Always\n\n(We tell the gRPC service to run on port 9999, then map the container's port 80 inbound to simplify the Mapping. There's no magic behind these port numbers: anything will work as long as you're consistent in when mapping everything.)\nThis is available from getambassador.io, so you can simply\nkubectl apply -f https://getambassador.io/yaml/demo/demo-grpc.yaml\n\nor, as always, you can use a local file instead.\nTesting Hello World\nNow you should be able to access your service. We'll need the hostname for the Ambassador service, which you can get with\nkubectl get svc -o wide ambassador\n\nThis should give you something like\nNAME         CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)        AGE\nambassador   10.11.12.13     35.36.37.38     80:31656/TCP   1m\nand the EXTERNAL-IP element is what we want. We'll call that $AMBASSADORHOST. You'll also need the port: if you haven't explicitly configured Ambassador otherwise, this should be 80 for an HTTP Ambassador or 443 for an HTTPS Ambassador. We'll call that $AMBASSADORPORT.\nTo test Hello World, we can use the Docker image enm10k/grpc-hello-world:\ndocker run -e ADDRESS=${AMBASSADORHOST}:${AMBASSADORPORT} enm10k/grpc-hello-world greeter_client\n\nNote: If you're trying this out using NodePort on minikube and running the docker command above on your host machine, make sure to pass the --network host parameter to the docker command.\nUsing over TLS\nTo enable grpc over TLS, ALPN protocol http2 alpn_protocols: h2 must be added to the TLS module configuration. Refer to TLS termination guide for more information.\nNote\nSome Kubernetes ingress controllers do not support HTTP/2 fully. As a result, if you are running Ambassador with an ingress controller in front, you may find that gRPC requests fail even with correct Ambassador configuration.\nA simple way around this is to use Ambassador with a LoadBalancer service, rather than an Ingress controller.\n"},"user-guide/tls-termination.html":{"url":"user-guide/tls-termination.html","title":"TLS Termination","keywords":"","body":"TLS Termination\nTo enable TLS termination for Ambassador you'll need a few things:\n\nYou'll need a TLS certificate.\nFor any production use, you'll need a DNS record that matches your TLS certificate's Common Name.\nYou'll need to store the certificate in a Kubernetes secret.\nYou may need to configure other Ambassador TLS options using the tls module.\n\nAll these requirements mean that it's easiest to decide to enable TLS before you configure Ambassador the first time. It's possible to switch after setting up Ambassador, but it's annoying.\n1. You'll need a TLS certificate.\nThere are a great many ways to get a certificate; Let's Encrypt is a good option if you're not already working with something else. \nNote that requesting a certificate requires a Common Name (CN) for your Ambassador. The CN becomes very important when you try to use HTTPS in practice: if the CN does not match the DNS name you use to reach the Ambassador, most TLS libraries will refuse to make the connection. So use a DNS name for the CN, and in step 2 make sure everything matches.\n2. You'll need a DNS name.\nAs noted above, the DNS name must match the CN in the certificate. The simplest way to manage this is to create an ambassador Kubernetes service up front, before you do anything else, so that you can point DNS to whatever Kubernetes gives you for it -- then don't delete the ambassador service, even if you later need to update it or delete and recreate the ambassador deployment.\nkubectl apply -f https://www.getambassador.io/yaml/ambassador/ambassador-https.yaml\n\nwill create a minimal ambassador service for this purpose; you can then use its external appearance to configure either a CNAME or an A record in DNS. Make sure that there's a matching PTR record, too.\nIt's OK to include annotations on the ambassador service at this point, if you need to configure additional TLS options (see below for more on this).\n3. You'll need to store the certificate in a Kubernetes secret.\nCreate a Kubernetes secret named ambassador-certs:\nkubectl create secret tls ambassador-certs --cert=$FULLCHAIN_PATH --key=$PRIVKEY_PATH\n\nwhere $FULLCHAIN_PATH is the path to a single PEM file containing the certificate chain for your cert (including the certificate for your Ambassador and all relevant intermediate certs -- this is what Let's Encrypt calls fullchain.pem), and $PRIVKEY_PATH is the path to the corresponding private key.\nWhen Ambassador starts, it will notice the ambassador-certs secret and turn TLS on.\nImportant. If you've already created the ambassador deployment in step 2 or you're adding TLS termination to an existing deployment, you MUST restart it. Ambassador looks for the ambassador-certs when it starts and only watches service changes later on (#474). If high availability is not an issue, simply delete the ambassador pods (after a short downtime, the deployment will start new pods for you):\nkubectl delete pods -l service=ambassador\n\nTo ensure high availability, you can force a no-op rolling update (https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/27081):\nkubectl patch deployment ambassador -p \"{\\\"spec\\\":{\\\"template\\\":{\\\"metadata\\\":{\\\"annotations\\\":{\\\"date\\\":\\\"`date +'%s'`\\\"}}}}}\"\n\nConfiguring using a user defined secret\nIf you do not wish to use a secret named ambassador-certs, then you can tell Ambassador to use your own secret. This can be particularly useful if you want to use different secrets for different Ambassador deployments.\nCreate the secret -\nkubectl create secret tls user-secret --cert=$FULLCHAIN_PATH --key=$PRIVKEY_PATH\n\nAnd then, configure Ambassador's TLS module like the following -\napiVersion: ambassador/v0\nkind:  Module\nname:  tls\nconfig:\n  server:\n    enabled: True\n    secret: user-secret\n\nThis will make Ambassador load a secret called user-secret to configure TLS termination.\nNote: If ambassador-certs is present in the cluster and the TLS module is configured to load a custom secret, then ambassador-certs will take precedence, and the custom secret will be ignored.\n4. You may need to configure other Ambassador TLS options.\nIf you don't need anything else, you're good to go.\nHowever, you may also configure other options using Ambassador's tls module:\n---\napiVersion: ambassador/v0\nkind:  Module\nname:  tls\nconfig:\n  # The 'server' block configures TLS termination. 'enabled' is the only\n  # required element.\n  server:\n    # If 'enabled' is not True, TLS termination will not happen.\n    enabled: True\n\n    # If you set 'redirect_cleartext_from' to a port number, HTTP traffic \n    # to that port will be redirected to HTTPS traffic. Typically you would\n    # use port 80, of course.\n    # redirect_cleartext_from: 80\n\n    # These are optional. They should not be present unless you are using\n    # a custom Docker build to install certificates onto the container\n    # filesystem, in which case YOU WILL STILL NEED TO SET enabled: True\n    # above.\n    #\n    # cert_chain_file: /etc/certs/tls.crt   # remember to set enabled!\n    # private_key_file: /etc/certs/tls.key  # remember to set enabled!\n\n    # Enable TLS ALPN protocol, typically HTTP2 to negotiate it with \n    # HTTP2 clients over TLS.\n    # This must be set to be able to use grpc over TLS.\n    # alpn_protocols: h2\n\n  # The 'client' block configures TLS client-certificate authentication.\n  # 'enabled' is the only required element.\n  client:\n    # If 'enabled' is not True, TLS client-certificate authentication will\n    # not happen.\n    enabled: False\n\n    # If 'cert_required' is True, TLS client certificates will be required\n    # for every connection.\n    # cert_required: False\n\n    # This is optional. It should not be present unless you are using\n    # a custom Docker build to install certificates onto the container\n    # filesystem, in which case YOU WILL STILL NEED TO SET enabled: True\n    # above.\n    # \n    # cacert_chain_file: /etc/cacert/tls.crt  # remember to set enabled!\n\nOf these, redirect_cleartext_from is the most likely to be relevant: to make Ambassador redirect HTTP traffic on port 80 to HTTPS on port 443, you must use the tls module:\n---\napiVersion: ambassador/v0\nkind:  Module\nname:  tls\nconfig:\n  server:\n    enabled: True\n    redirect_cleartext_from: 80\n\nis the minimal YAML to do this.\nIf you need a tls module, it's simplest to include it as an annotation on the ambassador service itself. \nCertificate Manager\nJetstack's cert-manager lets you easily provision and manage TLS certificates on Kubernetes. No special configuration is required to use Ambassador with cert-manager.\nOnce cert-manager is running and you have successfully created the issuer, you can request a certificate such as the following:\napiVersion: certmanager.k8s.io/v1alpha1\nkind: Certificate\nmetadata:\n  name: cloud-foo-com\n  namespace: default\nspec:\n  secretName: ambassador-certs\n  issuerRef:\n    name: letsencrypt-prod\n    kind: ClusterIssuer\n  commonName: cloud.foo.com\n  dnsNames:\n  - cloud.foo.com\n  acme:\n    config:\n    - dns01:\n        provider: clouddns\n      domains:\n      - cloud.foo.com\nNote the secretName line above. When the certificate has been stored in the secret, restart Ambasador to pick up the new certificate.\n"},"user-guide/with-istio.html":{"url":"user-guide/with-istio.html","title":"Istio and Ambassador","keywords":"","body":"Ambassador and Istio: Edge Proxy and Service Mesh\n\nAmbassador is a Kubernetes-native API gateway for microservices. Ambassador is deployed at the edge of your network, and routes incoming traffic to your internal services (aka \"north-south\" traffic).  Istio is a service mesh for microservices, and is designed to add application-level Layer (L7) observability, routing, and resilience to service-to-service traffic (aka \"east-west\" traffic). Both Istio and Ambassador are built using Envoy.\nAmbassador and Istio can be deployed together on Kubernetes. In this configuration, incoming traffic from outside the cluster is first routed through Ambassador, which then routes the traffic to Istio-powered services. Ambassador handles authentication, edge routing, TLS termination, and other traditional edge functions.\nThis allows the operator to have the best of both worlds: a high performance, modern edge service (Ambassador) combined with a state-of-the-art service mesh (Istio). Istio's basic ingress controller is very limited, and has no support for authentication or many of the other features of Ambassador.\nGetting Ambassador Working With Istio\nGetting Ambassador working with Istio is straightforward. In this example, we'll use the bookinfo sample application from Istio.\n\nInstall Istio on Kubernetes, following the default instructions (without using mutual TLS auth between sidecars)\nNext, install the Bookinfo sample application, following the instructions.\nVerify that the sample application is working as expected.\n\nBy default, the Bookinfo application uses the Istio ingress. To use Ambassador, we need to:\n\nInstall Ambassador.\n\nFirst you will need to deploy the Ambassador ambassador-admin service to your cluster:\nIt's simplest to use the YAML files we have online for this (though of course you can download them and use them locally if you prefer!).\nFirst, you need to check if Kubernetes has RBAC enabled:\nkubectl cluster-info dump --namespace kube-system | grep authorization-mode\n\nIf you see something like --authorization-mode=Node,RBAC in the output, then RBAC is enabled.\nIf RBAC is enabled, you'll need to use:\nkubectl apply -f https://getambassador.io/yaml/ambassador/ambassador-rbac.yaml\n\nWithout RBAC, you can use:\nkubectl apply -f https://getambassador.io/yaml/ambassador/ambassador-no-rbac.yaml\n\n(Note that if you are planning to use mutual TLS for communication between Ambassador and Istio/services in the future, then the order in which you deploy the ambassador-admin service and the ambassador LoadBalancer service below may need to be swapped)\nNext you will deploy an ambassador service that acts as a point of ingress into the cluster via the LoadBalancer type. Create the following YAML and put it in a file called ambassador-service.yaml.\n---\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  labels:\n    service: ambassador\n  name: ambassador\n  annotations:\n    getambassador.io/config: |\n      ---\n      apiVersion: ambassador/v0\n      kind:  Mapping\n      name:  httpbin_mapping\n      prefix: /httpbin/\n      service: httpbin.org:80\n      host_rewrite: httpbin.org\nspec:\n  type: LoadBalancer\n  ports:\n  - name: ambassador\n    port: 80\n    targetPort: 80\n  selector:\n    service: ambassador\n\nThen, apply it to the Kubernetes with kubectl:\nkubectl apply -f ambassador-service.yaml\n\nThe YAML above does several things:\n\nIt creates a Kubernetes service for Ambassador, of type LoadBalancer. Note that if you're not deploying in an environment where LoadBalancer is a supported type (i.e. MiniKube), you'll need to change this to a different type of service, e.g., NodePort.\nIt creates a test route that will route traffic from /httpbin/ to the public httpbin.org HTTP Request and Response service (which provides useful endpoint that can be used for diagnostic purposes). In Ambassador, Kubernetes annotations (as shown above) are used for configuration. More commonly, you'll want to configure routes as part of your service deployment process, as shown in this more advanced example.\n\nYou can see if the two Ambassador services are running correctly (and also obtain the LoadBalancer IP address when this is assigned after a few minutes) by executing the following commands:\n$ kubectl get services\nNAME               TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP      PORT(S)          AGE\nambassador         LoadBalancer   10.63.247.1     35.224.41.XX     80:32171/TCP     11m\nambassador-admin   NodePort       10.63.250.17               8877:32107/TCP   12m\ndetails            ClusterIP      10.63.241.224              9080/TCP         16m\nkubernetes         ClusterIP      10.63.240.1                443/TCP          24m\nproductpage        ClusterIP      10.63.248.184              9080/TCP         16m\nratings            ClusterIP      10.63.255.72               9080/TCP         16m\nreviews            ClusterIP      10.63.252.192              9080/TCP         16m\n\n$ kubectl get pods\nNAME                             READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\nambassador-2680035017-092rk      2/2       Running   0          13m\nambassador-2680035017-9mr97      2/2       Running   0          13m\nambassador-2680035017-thcpr      2/2       Running   0          13m\ndetails-v1-3842766915-3bjwx      2/2       Running   0          17m\nproductpage-v1-449428215-dwf44   2/2       Running   0          16m\nratings-v1-555398331-80zts       2/2       Running   0          17m\nreviews-v1-217127373-s3d91       2/2       Running   0          17m\nreviews-v2-2104781143-2nxqf      2/2       Running   0          16m\nreviews-v3-3240307257-xl1l6      2/2       Running   0          16m\n\nAbove we see that external IP assigned to our LoadBalancer is 35.224.41.XX (XX is used to mask the actual value), and that all ambassador pods are running (Ambassador relies on Kubernetes to provide high availability, and so there should be two small pods running on each node within the cluster).\nYou can test if Ambassador has been installed correctly by using the test route to httpbin.org to get the external cluster Origin IP from which the request was made:\n$ curl 35.224.41.XX/httpbin/ip\n{\n  \"origin\": \"35.192.109.XX\"\n}\n\nIf you're seeing a similar response, then everything is working great!\n(Bonus: If you want to use a little bit of awk magic to export the LoadBalancer IP to a variable AMBASSADOR_IP, then you can type export AMBASSADOR_IP=$(kubectl get services ambassador | tail -1 | awk '{ print $4 }') and use curl $AMBASSADOR_IP/httpbin/ip\n\nNow you are going to modify the bookinfo demo bookinfo.yaml manifest to include the necessary Ambassador annotations. See below.\n\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: productpage\n  labels:\n    app: productpage\n  annotations:\n    getambassador.io/config: |\n      ---\n      apiVersion: ambassador/v0\n      kind: Mapping\n      name: productpage_mapping\n      prefix: /productpage/\n      rewrite: /productpage\n      service: productpage:9080\nspec:\n  ports:\n  - port: 9080\n    name: http\n  selector:\n    app: productpage\nThe annotation above implements an Ambassador mapping from the '/productpage/' URI to the Kubernetes productpage service running on port 9080 ('productpage:9080'). The 'prefix' mapping URI is taken from the context of the root of your Ambassador service that is acting as the ingress point (exposed externally via port 80 because it is a LoadBalancer) e.g. '35.224.41.XX/productpage/'.\nYou can now apply this manifest from the root of the Istio GitHub repo on your local file system (taking care to wrap the apply with istioctl kube-inject):\nkubectl apply -f \n\nOptionally, delete the Ingress controller from the bookinfo.yaml manifest by typing kubectl delete ingress gateway.\n\nTest Ambassador by going to the IP of the Ambassador LoadBalancer you configured above e.g. 35.192.109.XX/productpage/. You can see the actual IP address again for Ambassador by typing kubectl get services ambassador.\n\n\nAutomatic Sidecar Injection\nNewer versions of Istio support Kubernetes initializers to automatically inject the Istio sidecar. You don't need to inject the Istio sidecar into Ambassador's pods -- Ambassador's Envoy instance will automatically route to the appropriate service(s). Ambassador's pods are configured to skip sidecar injection, using an annotation as explained in the documentation.\nIstio Mutual TLS\nIn case Istio mutual TLS is enabled on the cluster, the mapping outlined above will not function correctly as the Istio sidecar will intercept the connections and the service will only be reachable via https using the Istio managed certificates, which are available in each namespace via the istio.default secret. To get the proxy working we need to tell Ambassador to use those certificates when communicating with Istio enabled service. To do this we need to modify the Ambassador deployment installed above.\nIn case of RBAC:\n---\napiVersion: extensions/v1beta1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: ambassador\nspec:\n  replicas: 3\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      annotations:\n        sidecar.istio.io/inject: \"false\"\n      labels:\n        service: ambassador\n    spec:\n      serviceAccountName: ambassador\n      containers:\n      - name: ambassador\n        image: quay.io/datawire/ambassador:0.33.1\n        resources:\n          limits:\n            cpu: 1\n            memory: 400Mi\n          requests:\n            cpu: 200m\n            memory: 100Mi\n        env:\n        - name: AMBASSADOR_NAMESPACE\n          valueFrom:\n            fieldRef:\n              fieldPath: metadata.namespace          \n        livenessProbe:\n          httpGet:\n            path: /ambassador/v0/check_alive\n            port: 8877\n          initialDelaySeconds: 30\n          periodSeconds: 3\n        readinessProbe:\n          httpGet:\n            path: /ambassador/v0/check_ready\n            port: 8877\n          initialDelaySeconds: 30\n          periodSeconds: 3\n        volumeMounts:\n          - mountPath: /etc/istiocerts/\n            name: istio-certs\n            readOnly: true\n      - name: statsd\n        image: quay.io/datawire/statsd:0.33.1\n      restartPolicy: Always\n      volumes:\n      - name: istio-certs\n        secret:\n          optional: true\n          secretName: istio.default\n\nSpecifically note the mounting of the Istio secrets. For non RBAC cluster modify accordingly. Next we need to modify the Ambassador configuration to tell it use the new certificates for Istio enabled services:\n---\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  labels:\n    service: ambassador\n  name: ambassador\n  annotations:\n    getambassador.io/config: |\n      ---\n      apiVersion: ambassador/v0\n      kind:  Mapping\n      name:  httpbin_mapping\n      prefix: /httpbin/\n      service: httpbin.org:80\n      host_rewrite: httpbin.org\n      ---\n      apiVersion: ambassador/v0\n      kind:  Module\n      name: tls\n      config:\n        server:\n          enabled: True\n          redirect_cleartext_from: 80\n        client:\n          enabled: False\n        upstream:\n          cert_chain_file: /etc/istiocerts/cert-chain.pem\n          private_key_file: /etc/istiocerts/key.pem\nspec:\n  type: LoadBalancer\n  ports:\n  - name: ambassador\n    port: 80\n    targetPort: 80\n  selector:\n    service: ambassador\n\nThis will define an upstream that uses the Istio certificates. We can now reuse the upstream in all Ambassador mappings to enable communication with Istio pods.\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: productpage\n  labels:\n    app: productpage\n  annotations:\n    getambassador.io/config: |\n      ---\n      apiVersion: ambassador/v0\n      kind: Mapping\n      name: productpage_mapping\n      prefix: /productpage/\n      rewrite: /productpage\n      tls: upstream\n      service: productpage:9080\nspec:\n  ports:\n  - port: 9080\n    name: http\n    protocol: TCP\n  selector:\n    app: productpage\n\nNote the tls: upstream, which lets Ambassador know which certificate to use when communicating with that service.\nIn the definition above we also have TLS termination enabled; please see the TLS termination tutorial for more details.\nTracing Integration\nIstio provides a tracing mechanism based on Zipkin, which is one of the drivers supported by Ambassador. In order to achieve an end-to-end tracing, it is possible to integrate Ambassador with Istio's Zipkin.First confirm that Istio's Zipkin is up and running in the istio-system Namespace:\n$ kubectl get service zipkin -n istio-system\nNAME      TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE\nzipkin    ClusterIP   10.102.146.104           9411/TCP   7m\n\nIf Istio's Zipkin is up & running on istio-system Namespace, add the TracingService annotation pointing to it:\n  annotations:\n    getambassador.io/config: |\n      ---\n      apiVersion: ambassador/v0\n      kind: TracingService\n      name: tracing\n      service: \"zipkin.istio-system:9411\"\n      driver: zipkin\n      config: {}\n\nNote: We are using the DNS entry zipkin.istio-system as well as the port that our service is running, in this case 9411.Please see Distributed Tracing for more details on Tracing configuration.\nMonitoring/Statistics Integration\nIstio also provides a Prometheus service that is an open-source monitoring and alerting system which is supported by Ambassador as well. It is possible to integrate Ambassador into Istio's Prometheus to have all statistics and monitoring in a single place.  \nFirst we need to change our Ambassador Deployment to use the Prometheus StatsD Exporter as its sidecar. Do this by applying the ambassador-rbac-prometheus.yaml:\n$ kubectl apply -f https://www.getambassador.io/yaml/ambassador/ambassador-rbac-prometheus.yaml\n\nThis YAML is changing the StatsD container definition on our Deployment to use the Prometheus StatsD Exporter as a sidecar:\n      - name: statsd-sink\n        image: datawire/prom-statsd-exporter:0.6.0\n      restartPolicy: Always\n\nNext, a Service needs to be created pointing to our Prometheus StatsD Exporter sidecar:\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: ambassador-monitor\n  labels:\n    app: ambassador\n    service: ambassador-monitor\nspec:\n  type: ClusterIP\n  ports:\n   - port: 9102\n     name: prometheus-metrics\n  selector:\n    service: ambassador\n\nNow we need to add a scrape configuration to Istio's Prometheus so that it can pool data from our Ambassador. This is done by applying the new ConfigMap:\n$ kubectl apply -f https://www.getambassador.io/yaml/ambassador/ambassador-istio-configmap.yaml\n\nThis ConfigMap YAML changes the prometheus ConfigMap that is on istio-system Namespace and adds the following:\n    - job_name: 'ambassador'\n      static_configs:\n      - targets: ['ambassador-monitor.default:9102']\n        labels:  {'application': 'ambassador'}\n\nNote: Assuming ambassador-monitor service is runnning in default namespace.  \nNote: You can also add the scrape by hand by using kubectl edit or dashboard.\nAfer adding the scrape, Istio's Prometheus POD needs to be restarted:\n$ export PROMETHEUS_POD=`kubectl get pods -n istio-system | grep prometheus | awk '{print $1}'`\n$ kubectl delete pod $PROMETHEUS_POD -n istio-system\n\nMore details can be found in Statistics and Monitoring.\nGrafana Dashboard\nIstio provides a Grafana dashboad service as well, and it is possible to import an Ambassador Dashboard into it, to monitor the Statistics provided by Prometheus. We're going to use Alex Gervais' template available on Grafana's website under entry 4689 as a starting point.  \nFirst let's start the port-forwarding for Istio's Grafana service:\n$ kubectl -n istio-system port-forward $(kubectl -n istio-system get pod -l app=grafana -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') 3000:3000 &\n\nNow, open Grafana tool by acessing: http://localhost:3000/\nTo install Ambassador Dashboard:\n\nClick on Create  \nSelect Import  \nEnter number 4698  \n\nNow we need to adjust the Dashboard Port to reflect our Ambassador configuration:\n\nOpen the Imported Dashboard\nClick on Settings in the Top Right corner\nClick on Variables\nChange the port to 80 (according to the ambassador service port)\n\nNext, adjust the Dashboard Registered Services metric:\n\nOpen the Imported Dashboard\nFind Registered Services\nClick on the down arrow and select Edit\nChange the Metric to:envoy_cluster_manager_active_clusters{job=\"ambassador\"}\n\n\n\nNow lets save the changes:\n\nClick on Save Dashboard in the Top Right corner\n\nRoadmap\nThere are a number of roadmap items that we'd like to tackle in improving Istio integration. This includes supporting Istio routing rules in Ambassador and full propagation of request headers (e.g., Zipkin tracing) between Ambassador and Istio. If you're interested in contributing, we'd welcome the help!\n"},"reference/configuration.html":{"url":"reference/configuration.html","title":"Configuring Ambassador","keywords":"","body":"Ambassador Configuration\nAmbassador is configured in a declarative fashion, using YAML manifests to describe the state of the world. As with Kubernetes, Ambassador's manifests are identified with apiVersion, kind, and name. The current apiVersion is ambassador/v0; currently-supported kinds are:\n\nModule manifests configure things with can apply to Ambassador as a whole. For example, the ambassador module can define listener ports, and the tls module can configure TLS termination for Ambassador.\n\nAuthService manifests configures the external authentication service[s] that Ambassador will use.\n\nRateLimitService manifests configures the external rate limiting service that Ambassador will use.\n\nTracingService manifests configures the external tracing service that Ambassador will use.\n\nMapping manifests associate REST resources with Kubernetes services. Ambassador must have one or more mappings defined to provide access to any services at all.\n\n\nConfiguration sources\nAmbassador assembles its configuration from YAML blocks that may be stored:\n\nas annotations on Kubernetes services (this is the recommended technique);\nas data in a Kubernetes ConfigMap; or\nas files in Ambassador's local filesystem.\n\nThe data contained within each YAML block is the same no matter where the blocks are stored, and multiple YAML documents are likewise supported no matter where the blocks are stored.\nBest Practices for Configuration\nAmbassador's configuration is assembled from multiple YAML blocks, to help enable self-service routing and make it easier for multiple developers to collaborate on a single larger application. This implies a few things:\n\nAmbassador's configuration should be under version control.\n  While you can always read back Ambassador's configuration from annotations or its diagnostic service, Ambassador will not do versioning for you. Tools like Forge can help you maintain proper version control for your services' routing configurations.\n\nBe aware that Ambassador tries to not start with a broken configuration, but it's not perfect.\n  Gross errors will result in Ambassador refusing to start, in which case kubectl logs will be helpful. However, it's always possible to e.g. map a resource to the wrong service, or use the wrong rewrite rules. Ambassador can't detect that on its own, although its diagnostic pages can help you figure it out.\n\nBe careful of mapping collisions.\n  If two different developers try to map /user/ to something, this can lead to unexpected behavior. Ambassador's canary-deployment logic means that it's more likely that traffic will be split between them than that it will throw an error -- again, the diagnostic service can help you here.\n\n\n"},"reference/modules.html":{"url":"reference/modules.html","title":"Core Configuration","keywords":"","body":"Core Configuration: Modules\nModules let you enable and configure special behaviors for Ambassador, in ways that may apply to Ambassador as a whole or which may apply only to some mappings. The actual configuration possible for a given module depends on the module.\nThe ambassador Module\nIf present, the ambassador module defines system-wide configuration. You may very well not need this module. The defaults in the ambassador module are, roughly:\n---\napiVersion: ambassador/v0\nkind:  Module\nname:  ambassador\nconfig:\n  # If present, service_port will be the port Ambassador listens\n  # on for microservice access. If not present, Ambassador will\n  # use 443 if TLS is configured, 80 otherwise. In future releases\n  # of Ambassador, this will change to 8080 when we run Ambassador\n  # as non-root by default.\n  # service_port: 80\n\n  # diag_port is the port where Ambassador will listen for requests\n  # to the diagnostic service.\n  # diag_port: 8877\n\n  # admin_port is the port where Ambassador's Envoy will listen for\n  # low-level admin requests. You should almost never need to change\n  # this.\n  # admin_port: 8001\n\n  # liveness probe defaults on, but you can disable the api route.\n  # It will remain accessible on diag_port.\n  # liveness_probe:\n  #   enabled: true\n\n  # readiness probe defaults on, but you can disable the api route.\n  # It will remain accessible on diag_port.\n  # readiness_probe:\n  #   enabled: true\n\n  # The diagnostic service (at /ambassador/v0/diag/) defaults on, but\n  # you can disable the api route. It will remain accessible on \n  # diag_port.\n  # diagnostics:\n  #   enabled: true\n\n  # use_proxy_protocol controls whether Envoy will honor the PROXY\n  # protocol on incoming requests.\n  # use_proxy_proto: false\n\n  # use_remote_address controls whether Envoy will trust the remote\n  # address of incoming connections or rely exclusively on the \n  # X-Forwarded_For header. \n  #\n  # The current default is not to include any use_remote_address setting,\n  # but THAT IS LIKELY TO CHANGE SOON.\n  # use_remote_address: false\n\n  # Ambassador lets through only the HTTP requests with\n  # `X-FORWARDED-PROTO: https` header set, and redirects all the other\n  # requests to HTTPS if this field is set to true.\n  # x_forwarded_proto_redirect: false\n\n  # Set default CORS configuration for all mappings in the cluster. See CORS syntax at https://www.getambassador.io/reference/cors.html\n  # cors:\n  #   origins: http://foo.example,http://bar.example\n  #   methods: POST, GET, OPTIONS\n  #   ...\n  #   ...\n\nuse_remote_address\nAmbassador is very likely to change to default use_remote_address to true\nvery soon. At present, use_remote_address still defaults to false; consider setting it to true if your application wants to have the incoming source address available. See the Envoy documentation for more information here.\nuse_proxy_proto\nMany load balancers can use the PROXY protocol to convey information about the connection they are proxying. In order to support this in Ambassador, you'll need to set use_proxy_protocol to true; this is not the default since the PROXY protocol is not compatible with HTTP.\nProbes\nThe default liveness and readiness probes map /ambassador/v0/check_alive and ambassador/v0/check_ready internally to check Envoy itself. If you'd like to, you can change these to route requests to some other service. For example, to have the readiness probe map to the Quote of the Moment's health check, you could do\nreadiness_probe:\n  service: qotm\n  rewrite: /health\n\nThe liveness and readiness probe both support prefix, rewrite, and service, with the same meanings as for mappings. Additionally, the enabled boolean may be set to false (as in the commented-out examples above) to disable support for the probe entirely.\nNote well that configuring the probes in the ambassador module only means that Ambassador will respond to the probes. You must still configure Kubernetes to perform the checks, as shown in the Datawire-provided YAML files.\nThe authentication Module\nThe authentication module is now deprecated. Use the AuthService manifest type instead.\n"},"reference/core/tls.html":{"url":"reference/core/tls.html","title":"TLS and X-Forwarded-Proto","keywords":"","body":"Transport Layer Security (TLS)\nAmbassador supports both terminating TLS and originating TLS. By default, Ambassador will enable TLS termination whenever it finds valid TLS certificates stored in the ambassador-certs Kubernetes secret. \nThe tls module\nThe tls module defines system-wide configuration for TLS when additional configuration is needed.\n---\napiVersion: ambassador/v0\nkind:  Module\nname:  tls\nconfig:\n  # The 'server' block configures TLS termination. 'enabled' is the only\n  # required element.\n  server:\n    # If 'enabled' is not True, TLS termination will not happen.\n    enabled: True\n\n    # If you set 'redirect_cleartext_from' to a port number, HTTP traffic \n    # to that port will be redirected to HTTPS traffic. Typically you would\n    # use port 80, of course.\n    # redirect_cleartext_from: 80\n\n    # These are optional. They should not be present unless you are using\n    # a custom Docker build to install certificates onto the container\n    # filesystem, in which case YOU WILL STILL NEED TO SET enabled: True\n    # above.\n    #\n    # cert_chain_file: /etc/certs/tls.crt   # remember to set enabled!\n    # private_key_file: /etc/certs/tls.key  # remember to set enabled!\n\n    # Enable TLS ALPN protocol, typically HTTP2 to negotiate it with \n    # HTTP2 clients over TLS.\n    # This must be set to be able to use grpc over TLS.\n    # alpn_protocols: h2\n\n  # The 'client' block configures TLS client-certificate authentication.\n  # 'enabled' is the only required element.\n  client:\n    # If 'enabled' is not True, TLS client-certificate authentication will\n    # not happen.\n    enabled: False\n\n    # If 'cert_required' is True, TLS client certificates will be required\n    # for every connection.\n    # cert_required: False\n\n    # This is optional. It should not be present unless you are using\n    # a custom Docker build to install certificates onto the container\n    # filesystem, in which case YOU WILL STILL NEED TO SET enabled: True\n    # above.\n    # \n    # cacert_chain_file: /etc/cacert/tls.crt  # remember to set enabled!\n\nRedirecting from cleartext to TLS\nThe most common case requiring a tls module is redirecting cleartext traffic on port 80 to HTTPS on port 443, which can be done with the following configuration:\n---\napiVersion: ambassador/v0\nkind:  Module\nname:  tls\nconfig:\n  server:\n    enabled: True\n    redirect_cleartext_from: 80\n\nX-FORWARDED-PROTO Redirect\nIn cases when TLS is being terminated at an external layer 7 load balancer, then you would want to redirect only the originating HTTP requests to HTTPS, and let the originating HTTPS requests pass through.\nThis distinction between an originating HTTP request and an originating HTTPS request is done based on the X-FORWARDED-PROTO header that the external layer 7 load balancer adds to every request it forwards after TLS termination.\nTo enable this X-FORWARDED-PROTO based HTTP to HTTPS redirection, add a x_forwarded_proto_redirect: true field to the Ambassador module configuration, e.g.,\napiVersion: ambassador/v0\nkind: Module\nname: ambassador\nconfig:\n  x_forwarded_proto_redirect: true\n\nNote: Setting x_forwarded_proto_redirect: true will impact all your Ambassador mappings. Requests that contain have X-FORWARDED-PROTO set to https will be passed through. Otherwise, for all other values of X-FORWARDED-PROTO, they will be redirected to TLS.\nAuthentication with TLS Client Certificates\nAmbassador also supports TLS client-certificate authentcation. After enabling TLS termination, collect the full CA certificate chain (including all necessary intermediate certificates) into a single file. Store the CA certificate chain used to validate the client certificate into a Kubernetes secret named ambassador-cacert:\nkubectl create secret generic ambassador-cacert --from-file=tls.crt=$CACERT_PATH\n\nwhere $CACERT_PATH is the path to the single file mentioned above.\nIf you want to require client-cert authentication for every connection, you can add the cert_required key:\nkubectl create secret generic ambassador-cacert --from-file=tls.crt=$CACERT_PATH --from-literal=cert_required=true\n\nWhen Ambassador starts, it will notice the ambassador-cacert secret and turn TLS client-certificate auth on (assuming that TLS termination is enabled).\nUsing a user defined secret\nIf you do not wish to use a secret named ambassador-cacert, then you can specify your own secret. This can be particularly useful if you want to use different secrets for different Ambassador deployments in your cluster.\nCreate the secret -\nkubectl create secret generic user-secret --from-file=tls.crt=$CACERT_PATH\n\nAnd then, configure Ambassador's TLS module like the following -\napiVersion: ambassador/v0\nkind:  Module\nname:  tls\nconfig:\n  client:\n    enabled: True\n    secret: user-secret\n\nNote: If ambassador-cacert is present in the cluster and the TLS module is configured to load a custom secret, then ambassador-cacert will take precedence, and the custom secret will be ignored.\nMore reading\nThe TLS termination guide provides a tutorial on getting started with TLS in Ambassador.

Note that this document, while intended for AWS users, has information also applicable to other cloud providers.\n"},"reference/mappings.html":{"url":"reference/mappings.html","title":"Configuring Services","keywords":"","body":"Configuring Services\nAmbassador is designed so that the author of a given Kubernetes service can easily and flexibly configure how traffic gets routed to the service. The core abstraction used to support service authors is a mapping.\nMappings\nMappings associate REST resources with Kubernetes services. A resource, here, is a group of things defined by a URL prefix; a service is exactly the same as in Kubernetes. Ambassador must have one or more mappings defined to provide access to any services at all.\nEach mapping can also specify, among other things:\n\na rewrite rule which modifies the URL as it's handed to the Kubernetes service;\na weight specifying how much of the traffic for the resource will be routed using the mapping;\na host specifying a required value for the HTTP Host header;\na shadow marker, specifying that this mapping will get a copy of traffic for the resource; and\nother headers which must appear in the HTTP request.\n\nDefining Mappings\nMapping definitions are fairly straightforward. Here's an example for a REST service which Ambassador will contact using HTTP:\n---\napiVersion: ambassador/v0\nkind:  Mapping\nname:  qotm_mapping\nprefix: /qotm/\nservice: http://qotm\n\nand a REST service which Ambassador will contact using HTTPS:\n---\napiVersion: ambassador/v0\nkind:  Mapping\nname:  quote_mapping\nprefix: /qotm/quote/\nrewrite: /quotation/\nservice: https://qotm\n\n(Note that the 'http://' prefix for an HTTP service is optional.)\nHere's an example for a CQRS service (using HTTP):\n---\napiVersion: ambassador/v0\nkind: Mapping\nname: cqrs_get_mapping\nprefix: /cqrs/\nmethod: GET\nservice: getcqrs\n---\napiVersion: ambassador/v0\nkind: Mapping\nname: cqrs_put_mapping\nprefix: /cqrs/\nmethod: PUT\nservice: putcqrs\n\nRequired attributes for mappings:\n\nname is a string identifying the Mapping (e.g. in diagnostics)\nprefix is the URL prefix identifying your resource\nservice is the name of the service handling the resource; must include the namespace (e.g. myservice.othernamespace) if the service is in a different namespace than Ambassador\n\nConfiguring Mappings\nAmbassador supports a number of additional attributes to configure and customize mappings.\n\n\n\nAttribute\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nadd_request_headers\nspecifies a dictionary of other HTTP headers that should be added to each request when talking to the service\n\n\ncors\nenables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) setting on a mapping\n\n\ngrpc\nif true, tells the system that the service will be handling gRPC calls\n\n\nheaders\nspecifies a list of other HTTP headers which must appear in the request for this mapping to be used to route the request\n\n\nhost\nspecifies the value which must appear in the request's HTTP Host header for this mapping to be used to route the request\n\n\nhost_regex\nif true, tells the system to interpret the host as a regular expression\n\n\nhost_rewrite\nforces the HTTP Host header to a specific value when talking to the service\n\n\nmethod\ndefines the HTTP method for this mapping (e.g. GET, PUT, etc. -- must be all uppercase)\n\n\nmethod_regex\nif true, tells the system to interpret the method as a regular expression\n\n\nprefix_regex\nif true, tells the system to interpret the prefix as a regular expression\n\n\nrate_limits\nspecifies a list rate limit rules on a mapping\n\n\nregex_headers\nspecifies a list of HTTP headers and regular expressions which must match for this mapping to be used to route the request\n\n\nrewrite\nreplaces the URL prefix with when talking to the service\n\n\ntimeout_ms\nthe timeout, in milliseconds, for requests through this Mapping. Defaults to 3000.\n\n\ntls\nif true, tells the system that it should use HTTPS to contact this service. (It's also possible to use tls to specify a certificate to present to the service.)\n\n\nuse_websocket\nif true, tells Ambassador that this service will use websockets\n\n\n\nAmbassador supports multiple deployment patterns for your services. These patterns are designed to let you safely release new versions of your service, while minimizing its impact on production users.\n\n\n\nAttribute\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nshadow\nif true, a copy of the resource's traffic will go the service for this Mapping, and the reply will be ignored.\n\n\nweight\nspecifies the (integer) percentage of traffic for this resource that will be routed using this mapping\n\n\n\nThese attributes are less commonly used, but can be used to override Ambassador's default behavior in specific cases.\n\n\n\nAttribute\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nauto_host_rewrite\nif true, forces the HTTP Host header to the service to which Ambassador routes\n\n\ncase_sensitive\ndetermines whether prefix matching is case-sensitive; defaults to True\n\n\nenvoy_override\nsupplies raw configuration data to be included with the generated Envoy route entry.\n\n\nhost_redirect\nif true, this Mapping performs an HTTP 301 Redirect, with the host portion of the URL replaced with the service value.\n\n\npath_redirect\nif set when host_redirect is also true, the path portion of the URL will replaced with the path_redirect value in the HTTP 301 Redirect.\n\n\nprecedence\nan integer overriding Ambassador's internal ordering for Mappings. An absent precedence is the same as a precedence of 0. Higher precedence values are matched earlier.\n\n\n\nThe name of the mapping must be unique. If no method is given, all methods will be proxied.\nMapping Evaluation Order\nAmbassador sorts mappings such that those that are more highly constrained are evaluated before those less highly constrained. The prefix length, the request method and the constraint headers are all taken into account.\nIf absolutely necessary, you can manually set a precedence on the mapping (see below). In general, you should not need to use this feature unless you're using the regex_headers or host_regex matching features. If there's any question about how Ambassador is ordering rules, the diagnostic service is a good first place to look: the order in which mappings appear in the diagnostic service is the order in which they are evaluated.\nOptional Fallback Mapping\nAmbassador will respond with a 404 Not Found to any request for which no mapping exists. If desired, you can define a fallback \"catch-all\" mapping so all unmatched requests will be sent to an upstream service.\nFor example, defining a mapping with only a / prefix will catch all requests previously unhandled and forward them to an external service:\n---\napiVersion: ambassador/v0\nkind: Mapping\nname: catch-all\nprefix: /\nservice: https://www.getambassador.io\n\n Using precedence\nAmbassador sorts mappings such that those that are more highly constrained are evaluated before those less highly constrained. The prefix length, the request method and the constraint headers are all taken into account. These mechanisms, however, may not be sufficient to guarantee the correct ordering when regular expressions or highly complex constraints are in play.\nFor those situations, a Mapping can explicitly specify the precedence.

However, note that if the tls attribute is present and true, Ambassador will originate TLS even if the service does not have the https:// prefix.\nIf tls is present with a value that is not true, the value is assumed to be the name of a defined TLS context, which will determine the certificate presented to the upstream service. TLS context handling is a beta feature of Ambassador at present; please contact us on Slack if you need to specify TLS origination certificates.\nNamespaces and Mappings\nGiven that AMBASSADOR_NAMESPACE is correctly set, Ambassador can map to services in other namespaces by taking advantage of Kubernetes DNS:\n\nservice: servicename will route to a service in the same namespace as the Ambassador, and\nservice: servicename.namespace will route to a service in a different namespace.\n\nResources\nTo Ambassador, a resource is a group of one or more URLs that all share a common prefix in the URL path. For example:\nhttps://ambassador.example.com/resource1/foo\nhttps://ambassador.example.com/resource1/bar\nhttps://ambassador.example.com/resource1/baz/zing\nhttps://ambassador.example.com/resource1/baz/zung\n\nall share the /resource1/ path prefix, so can be considered a single resource. On the other hand:\nhttps://ambassador.example.com/resource1/foo\nhttps://ambassador.example.com/resource2/bar\nhttps://ambassador.example.com/resource3/baz/zing\nhttps://ambassador.example.com/resource4/baz/zung\n\nshare only the prefix / -- you could tell Ambassador to treat them as a single resource, but it's probably not terribly useful.\nNote that the length of the prefix doesn't matter: if you want to use prefixes like /v1/this/is/my/very/long/resource/name/, go right ahead, Ambassador can handle it.\nAlso note that Ambassador does not actually require the prefix to start and end with / -- however, in practice, it's a good idea. Specifying a prefix of\n/man\n\nwould match all of the following:\nhttps://ambassador.example.com/man/foo\nhttps://ambassador.example.com/mankind\nhttps://ambassador.example.com/man-it-is/really-hot-today\nhttps://ambassador.example.com/manohmanohman\n\nwhich is probably not what was intended.\nServices\nA service is simply a URL to Ambassador. For example:\n\nservicename assumes that DNS can resolve the bare servicename, and that it's listening on the default HTTP port;\nservicename.domain supplies a domain name (for example, you might do this to route across namespaces in Kubernetes); and\nservice:3000 supplies a nonstandard port number.\n\nAt present, Ambassador relies on Kubernetes to do load balancing: it trusts that using the DNS to look up the service by name will do the right thing in terms of spreading the load across all instances of the service.\n"},"reference/canary.html":{"url":"reference/canary.html","title":"Canary Releases","keywords":"","body":"Canary releases\nCanary releasing is a deployment pattern where a small percentage of traffic is diverted to an early (\"canary\") release of a particular service. This technique lets you test a release on a small subset of users, mitigating the impact of any given bug. Canary releasing also allows you to quickly roll back to a known good version in the event of an unexpected error. Detailed monitoring of core service metrics is an essential part of canary releasing, as monitoring enables the rapid detection of problems in the canary release.\nCanary releases in Kubernetes\nKubernetes supports a basic canary release workflow using its core objects. In this workflow, a service owner can create a Kubernetes service. This service can then be pointed to multiple deployments. Each deployment can be a different version. By specifying the number of replicas in a given deployment, you can control how much traffic goes between different versions. For example, you could set replicas: 3 for v1, and replicas: 1 for v2, to ensure that 25% of traffic goes to v2. This approach works, but is fairly coarse grained unless you have lots of replicas. Moreover, auto scaling doesn't work well with this strategy.\nCanary releases in Ambassador\nAmbassador supports fine-grained canary releases. Ambassador uses a weighted round robin scheme to route traffic between multiple services. Full metrics are collected for all services, making it easy to compare the relative performance of the canary and production. \nThe weight annotation\nThe weight attribute specifies how much traffic for a given resource will be routed using a given mapping. Its value is an integer percentage between 0 and 100. Ambassador will balance weights to make sure that, for every resource, the mappings for that resource will have weights adding to 100%. (In the simplest case, a single mapping is guaranteed to receive 100% of the traffic no matter whether it's assigned a weight or not.)\nSpecifying a weight only makes sense if you have multiple mappings for the same resource, and typically you would not assign a weight to the \"default\" mapping (the mapping expected to handle most traffic): letting Ambassador assign that mapping all the traffic not otherwise spoken for tends to make life easier when updating weights. Here's an example, which might appear during a canary deployment:\n---\napiVersion: ambassador/v0\nkind:  Mapping\nname:  qotm_mapping\nprefix: /qotm/\nservice: qotm\n---\napiVersion: ambassador/v0\nkind: Mapping\nname: qotm2_mapping\nprefix: /qotm/\nservice: qotmv2\nweight: 10\n\nIn this case, the qotm2_mapping will receive 10% of the requests for /qotm/, and Ambassador will assign the remaining 90% to the qotm_mapping.\n"},"reference/cors.html":{"url":"reference/cors.html","title":"Cross Origin Resource Sharing","keywords":"","body":"Cross-Origin Resource Sharing\nCross-Origin resource sharing lets users request resources (e.g., images, fonts, videos) from domains outside the original domain.\nCORS configuration can be set for all Ambassador mappings in the ambassador module, or set per mapping.\nThe cors attribute\nThe cors attribute enables the CORS filter.

For many microservices this will be fine, but if you use Ambassador to route to services that use the Host header for routing, it's likely to fail (legacy monoliths are particularly susceptible to this, as well as external services). You can use host_rewrite to force the Host header to whatever value that such target services need.\nAn example: the default Ambassador configuration includes the following mapping for httpbin.org:\n---\napiVersion: ambassador/v0\nkind: Mapping\nname: httpbin_mapping\nprefix: /httpbin/\nservice: httpbin.org:80\nhost_rewrite: httpbin.org\n\nAs it happens, httpbin.org is virtually hosted, and it simply will not function without a Host header of httpbin.org, which means that the host_rewrite attribute is necessary here.\nhost and method\nInternally:\n\nthe host attribute becomes a header match on the :authority header; and\nthe method attribute becomes a header match on the :method header.\n\nYou will see these headers in the diagnostic service if you use the method or host attributes.\n"},"reference/rate-limits.html":{"url":"reference/rate-limits.html","title":"Rate Limits","keywords":"","body":"Rate Limits\nA mapping that specifies the rate_limits list attribute and at least one rate_limits rule, will call the external RateLimitService before proceeding with the request.

Shadowing is a close cousin to two other commonly known deployment patterns, canary releases and blue/green deployments. Shadowing traffic has several important benefits over blue/green and canary testing:\n\nZero production impact. Since traffic is duplicated, any bugs in services that are processing shadow data have no impact on production.\n\nTest persistent services. Since there is no production impact, shadowing provides a powerful technique to test persistent services. You can configure your test service to store data in a test database, and shadow traffic to your test service for testing. Both blue/green deployments and canary deployments require more machinery for testing.\n\nTest the actual behavior of a service. When used in conjunction with tools such as Twitter's Diffy, shadowing lets you measure the behavior of your service and compare it with an expected output. A typical canary rollout catches exceptions (e.g., HTTP 500 errors), but what happens when your service has a logic error and is not returning an exception?\n\n\nShadowing and Ambassador\nAmbassador lets you easily shadow traffic to a given endpoint. In Ambassador, only requests are shadowed; responses from a service are dropped. All normal metrics are collected for the shadow services. This makes it easy to compare the performance of the shadow service versus the production service on the same data set. Ambassador also prioritizes the production path, i.e., it will return responses from the production service without waiting for any responses from the shadow service. \n\nThe shadow annotation\nIn Ambassador, you can enable shadowing for a given mapping by setting shadow: true in your Mapping.  One copy proceeds as if the shadowing Mapping was not present: the request is handed onward per the service(s) defined by the non-shadow Mappings, and the reply from whichever service is picked is handed back to the client.\nThe second copy is handed to the service defined by the Mapping with shadow set. Any reply from this service is ignored, rather than being handed back to the client. Only a single shadow per resource can be specified (i.e., you can't shadow the same resource to more than 1 additional destination). In this situation, Ambassador will indicate an error in the diagnostic service, and only one shadow will be used. If you need to implement this type of use case, you should shadow traffic to a multicast proxy (or equivalent).\nYou can shadow multiple different services.\nDuring shadowing, the host header is modified such that -shadow is appended.\nExample\nThe following example may help illustrate how shadowing can be used. This first annotation sets up a basic mapping between the myservice Kubernetes service and the /myservice/ prefix, as expected.\n  getambassador.io/config: |\n      ---\n      apiVersion: ambassador/v0\n      kind: Mapping\n      name: myservice-mapping\n      prefix: /myservice/\n      service: myservice.default\nWhat if we want to shadow the traffic to myservice, and send that exact same traffic to myservice-shadow? We can create a new mapping that does this:\n  getambassador.io/config: |\n      ---\n      apiVersion: ambassador/v0\n      kind: Mapping\n      name: myservice-shadow-mapping\n      prefix: /myservice/\n      service: myservice-shadow.default\n      shadow: true\nThe prefix is set to be the same as the first annotation, which tells Ambassador which production traffic to shadow. The destination service, where the shadow traffic is routed, is a different Kubernetes service, myservice-shadow.

Note well that all services must use the same path_prefix and allowed_headers; if you try to have different values, you'll see an error in the diagnostics service, telling you which value is being used.\nUsing the AuthService API\nBy design, the AuthService interface is highly flexible. The authentication service is the first external service invoked on an incoming request (e.g., it runs before the rate limit filter). Because the logic of authentication is encapsulated in an external service, you can use this to support a wide variety of use cases. For example:\n\nSupporting traditional SSO authentication protocols, e.g., OAuth, OpenID Connect, etc.\nSupport HTTP basic authentication (sample implementation available at:  https://github.com/datawire/ambassador-auth-httpbasic)\nOnly authenticating requests that are under a rate limit, and rejecting authentication requests above the rate limit\nAuthenticating specific services (URLs), and not others\n\nAuthService and TLS\nYou can tell Ambassador to use TLS to talk to your service by using an auth_service with an https:// prefix. However, you may also provide a tls attribute: if tls is present and true, Ambassador will originate TLS even if the service does not have the https:// prefix.\nIf tls is present with a value that is not true, the value is assumed to be the name of a defined TLS context, which will determine the certificate presented to the upstream service. TLS context handling is a beta feature of Ambassador at present; please contact us on Slack if you need to specify TLS origination certificates.\nThe External Authentication Service\nThe external auth service receives information about every request through Ambassador, and must indicate whether the request is to be allowed, or not. If not, the external auth service provides the response which is to be handed back to the client. The control flow for Authentication is shown below.\n\nThe Request\nFor every incoming request, the HTTP method and headers are forwarded to the auth service. Only two changes are made:\n\nThe Content-Length header is overwritten with 0.\nThe body is removed.\n\nSo, for example, if the incoming request is \nPUT /path/to/service HTTP/1.1\nHost: myservice.example.com:80\nUser-Agent: curl/7.54.0\nAccept: */*\nContent-Type: application/json\nContent-Length: 27\n\n{ \"greeting\": \"hello world!\", \"spiders\": \"OMG no\" }\nthen the request Ambassador will make of the auth service is:\nPUT /path/to/service HTTP/1.1\nHost: extauth.example.com:80\nUser-Agent: curl/7.54.0\nAccept: */*\nContent-Type: application/json\nContent-Length: 0\nALL request methods will be proxied, which implies that the auth service must be able to handle any request that any client could make. If desired, Ambassador can add a prefix to the path before forwarding it to the auth service; see the example below.\nAllowing the Request to Continue (HTTP status code 200)\nTo tell Ambassador that the request should be allowed, the external auth service must return an HTTP status of 200. Note well that only 200 indicates success; other 2yz status codes will prevent the request from continuing, as below.\nThe 200 response should not contain any body, but may contain arbitrary headers. Any header present in the response that is also listed in the allow_headers attribute of the AuthService resource will be copied from the external auth response into the request going upstream. This allows the external auth service to inject tokens or other information into the request, or to modify headers coming from the client.\nPreventing the Request from Continuing (any HTTP status code other than 200)\nAny HTTP status code other than 200 from the external auth service tells Ambassador not to allow the request to continue. In this case, the entire response from the external auth service - including the status code, the headers, and the body - is handed back to the client verbatim. This gives the external auth service complete control over the entire response presented to the client.\nGiving the external auth service control over the response on failure allows many different types of auth mechanisms, for example:\n\nThe external auth service can simply return an error page with an HTTP 401 response.\nThe external auth service can choose to include a WWW-Authenticate header in the 401 response, to ask the client to perform HTTP Basic Auth.\nThe external auth service can issue a 301 Redirect to divert the client into an OAuth or OIDC authentication sequence.\n\nFinally, if Ambassador cannot reach the auth service at all, it will return a HTTP 503 status code to the client.\nExample\nSee the Ambassador Authentication Tutorial for an example.\n"},"reference/services/rate-limit-service.html":{"url":"reference/services/rate-limit-service.html","title":"Rate Limiting","keywords":"","body":"Rate Limiting with the RateLimitService\nOccasionally, your services may become overwhelmed with too many requests.

This rate limiting is based on Envoy Proxy's rate limiting capabilities.\nA RateLimitService manifest configures Ambassador to use an external service to check and enforce rate limits for incoming requests:\n---\napiVersion: ambassador/v0\nkind: RateLimitService\nname: ratelimit\nservice: \"example-rate-limit:5000\"\n\n\nservice gives the URL of the rate limit service.\n\nYou may only use a single RateLimitService manifest.\nThe external rate limiting service\nWhen using an external rate limit service, Ambassador will generate a gRPC request to the external rate limit service and will provide a list of descriptors on which the rate limit service can base its decision to accept or reject the request:\n[\n  {\"source_cluster\", \"\"},\n  {\"destination_cluster\", \"\"},\n  {\"remote_address\", \"\"},\n  {\"generic_key\", \"\"},\n  {\"\", \"\"}\n]\nThis gRPC service must implement the Envoy ratelimit.proto.\nIf Ambassador cannot contact the rate limit service, it will allow the request to be processed as if there were no rate limit service configuration.\nIt is the external rate limit service's responsibility to determine whether rate limiting should take place, depending on custom business logic. The rate limit service must simply respond to the request with an OK or OVER_LIMIT code:\n\nIf Envoy receives an OK response from the rate limit service, then Ambassador allows the client request to resume being processed by the normal Ambassador Envoy flow.\nIf Ambassador receives an OVER_LIMIT response, then Ambassador will return an HTTP 429 response to the client and will end the transaction flow, preventing the request from reaching the backing service.\n\nThe headers injected by the AuthService can also be passed to the rate limit service since the AuthService is invoked before the RateLimitService.\nExample\nThe Ambassador Rate Limiting Tutorial has a simple rate limiting example. A more comprehensive example of a Java-based rate limiting service for Ambassador is discussed in this tutorial.\nFurther reading\n\nRate limiting: a useful tool with distributed systems\nRate limiting for API Gateways\nImplementing a Java Rate Limiting Service for Ambassador\nDesigning a Rate Limit Service for Ambassador\n\n"},"reference/services/tracing-service.html":{"url":"reference/services/tracing-service.html","title":"Tracing","keywords":"","body":"Distributed Tracing\nApplications that consist of multiple services can be difficult to debug, as a single request can span multiple services. Distributed tracing tells the story of your request as it is processed through your system. Distributed tracing is a powerful tool to debug and analyze your system in addition to request logging and metrics.\nThe TracingService\nWhen enabled, the TracingService will instruct Ambassador to initiate a trace on requests by generating and populating an x-request-id HTTP header. Services can make use of this x-request-id header in logging and forward it in downstream requests for tracing. Ambassador also integrates with external trace visualization services, including LightStep and Zipkin-compatible APIs such as Zipkin and Jaeger to allow you to store and visualize traces. You can read further on Envoy's Tracing capabilities.\nA TracingService manifest configures Ambassador to use an external trace visualization service:\n---\napiVersion: ambassador/v0\nkind: TracingService\nname: tracing\nservice: \"example-zipkin:9411\"\ndriver: zipkin\nconfig: {}\ntag_headers:\n- \":authority\"\n- \":path\"\n\n\nservice gives the URL of the external HTTP trace service.\ndriver provides the driver information that handles communicating with the service.

If it exists, its contents will be used as the baseline Ambassador configuration.\nAmbassador will then scan Kubernetes services in its namespace, looking for annotations named getambassador.io/config. YAML from these annotations will be merged into the baseline Ambassador configuration.\nWhenever any services change, Ambassador will update its annotation-based configuration.\nThe baseline configuration, if present, will never be updated after Ambassador starts. To effect a change in the baseline configuration, use Kubernetes to force a redeployment of Ambassador.\n\nNote: We recommend using only annotation-based configuration, so that Ambassador can respond to updates in its environment.\nModifying Ambassador's Underlying Envoy Configuration\nAmbassador uses Envoy for the heavy lifting of proxying.\nIf you wish to use Envoy features that aren't (yet) exposed by Ambassador, you can use the envoy_override annotation. This annotation lets you add additional configuration for Envoy routes.\nIf you need to add additional configuration for Envoy clusters, you will need to use your own custom configuration template. To do this, create a templated envoy.json file using the Jinja2 template language, and use this to to  replace the default template. This method is not officially supported -- if you need to do this, please open a GitHub issue and contact us on Slack for more information if this seems necessary so that we can explore direct Ambassador support for your use case (or, better yet, submit a PR!).\nConfiguring Ambassador via a Custom Image\nYou can also run Ambassador by building a custom image that contains baked-in configuration:\n\nAll the configuration data should be collected within a single directory on the filesystem.\nAt image startup, run ambassador config $configdir $envoy_json_out where\n$configdir is the path of the directory containing the configuration data, and\n$envoy_json_out is the path to the envoy.json to be written.\n\n\n\nIn this usage, Ambassador will not look for annotation-based configuration, and will not update any configuration after startup.\n"},"reference/running.html":{"url":"reference/running.html","title":"Running Ambassador","keywords":"","body":"Running Ambassador\nThis section is intended for operators running Ambassador, and covers various aspects of deploying and configuring Ambassador in production.\nAmbassador and Kubernetes\nAmbassador relies on Kubernetes for reliability, availability, and scalability. This means that features such as Kubernetes readiness and liveness probes, rolling updates, and the Horizontal Pod Autoscaling should be utilized to manage Ambassador.\nDefault configuration\nThe default configuration of Ambassador includes default resource limits, as well as readiness and liveness probes. These values should be adjusted for your specific environment.\nRunning as non-root\nStarting with Ambassador 0.35, we support running Ambassador as non-root. This is the recommended configuration, and will be the default configuration in future releases. We recommend you configure Ambassador to run as non-root as follows:\n\nHave Kubernetes run Ambassador as non-root. This may happen by default (e.g., OpenShift) or you can set a securityContext in your Deployment as shown below in this abbreviated example:\n\n---\napiVersion: extensions/v1beta1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: ambassador\nspec:\n  replicas: 1\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        service: ambassador\n    spec:\n      containers:\n        image: quay.io/datawire/ambassador:0.35.0\n        name: ambassador\n     restartPolicy: Always\n     securityContext:\n       runAsUser: 8888\n     serviceAccountName: ambassador\n\n\nSet the service_port element in the ambassador Module to 8080 (cleartext) or 8443 (TLS). This is the port that Ambassador will use to listen to incoming traffic. Note that any port number above 1024 will work; Ambassador will use 8080/8443 as its defaults in the future.\n\nMake sure that incoming traffic to Ambassador is configured to route to the service_port. If you're using the default Ambassador configuration, this means configuring the targetPort to point to the service_port above.\n\nIf you are using redirect_cleartext_from, change the value of this field to point to your cleartext port (e.g., 8080) and set service_port to be your TLS port (e.g., 8443).\n\n\nNamespaces\nAmbassador supports multiple namespaces within Kubernetes. To make this work correctly, you need to set the AMBASSADOR_NAMESPACE environment variable in Ambassador's container. By far the easiest way to do this is using Kubernetes' downward API (this is included in the YAML files from getambassador.io):\nenv:\n- name: AMBASSADOR_NAMESPACE\n  valueFrom:\n    fieldRef:\n      fieldPath: metadata.namespace\n\nGiven that AMBASSADOR_NAMESPACE is set, Ambassador mappings can operate within the same namespace, or across namespaces. Note well that mappings will have to explicitly include the namespace with the service to cross namespaces; see the mapping documentation for more information.\nIf you only want Ambassador to only work within a single namespace, set AMBASSADOR_SINGLE_NAMESPACE as an environment variable.\nMultiple Ambassadors in One Cluster\nAmbassador supports running multiple Ambassadors in the same cluster, without restricting a given Ambassador to a single namespace. This is done with the AMBASSADOR_ID setting. In the Ambassador module, set the ambassador_id, e.g.,\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: ambassador\n  namespace: ambassador-1\n  labels:\n    app: ambassador\n  annotations:\n    getambassador.io/config: |\n      ---\n      apiVersion: ambassador/v0\n      kind:  Module\n      name:  ambassador\n      ambassador_id: ambassador-1\n\nThen, assign each Ambassador pod a unique AMBASSADOR_ID with the environment variable as part of your deployment:\nenv:\n- name: AMBASSADOR_ID\n  value: ambassador-1\n\nAmbassador will then only use YAML objects that include an appropriate ambassador_id attribute. For example, if Ambassador is given the ID ambassador-1 as above, then of these YAML objects, only the first two will be used:\n---\napiVersion: ambassador/v0\nkind:  Mapping\nname:  mapping_used_1\nambassador_id: ambassador-1\nprefix: /demo1/\nservice: demo1\n---\napiVersion: ambassador/v0\nkind:  Mapping\nname:  mapping_used_2\nambassador_id: [ \"ambassador-1\", \"ambassador-2\" ]\nprefix: /demo2/\nservice: demo2\n---\napiVersion: ambassador/v0\nkind:  Mapping\nname:  mapping_skipped_1\nprefix: /demo3/\nservice: demo3\n---\napiVersion: ambassador/v0\nkind:  Mapping\nname:  mapping_skipped_2\nambassador_id: ambassador-2\nprefix: /demo4/\nservice: demo4\n\nThe list syntax (shown in mapping_used_2 above) permits including a given object in the configuration for multiple Ambassadors. In this case mapping_used_2 will be included in the configuration for ambassador-1 and also for ambassador-2.\nNote well that any object can have an ambassador_id included so, for example, it is fully supported to use ambassador_id to qualify the ambassador Module, TLS, and AuthService objects.\nIf no AMBASSADOR_ID is assigned to an Ambassador, it will use the ID default. If no ambassador_id is present in a YAML object, it will also use the ID default.\nAMBASSADOR_VERIFY_SSL_FALSE\nBy default, Ambassador will verify the TLS certificates provided by the Kubernetes API. In some situations, the cluster may be deployed with self-signed certificates. In this case, set AMBASSADOR_VERIFY_SSL_FALSE to true to disable verifying the TLS certificates.\nReconfiguration Timing Configuration\nAmbassador is constantly watching for changes to the service annotations. When changes are observed, Ambassador generates a new Envoy configuration and restarts the Envoy handling the heavy lifting of routing. Three environment variables provide control over the timing of this reconfiguration:\n\nAMBASSADOR_RESTART_TIME (default 15) sets the minimum number of seconds between restarts. No matter how often services are changed, Ambassador will never restart Envoy more frequently than this.\n\nAMBASSADOR_DRAIN_TIME (default 5) sets the number of seconds that the Envoy will wait for open connections to drain on a restart. Connections still open at the end of this time will be summarily dropped.\n\nAMBASSADOR_SHUTDOWN_TIME (default 10) sets the number of seconds that Ambassador will wait for the old Envoy to clean up and exit on a restart. If Envoy is not able to shut down in this time, the Ambassador pod will exit. If this happens, it is generally indicative of issues with restarts being attempted too often.\n\n\nThese environment variables can be set much like AMBASSADOR_NAMESPACE, above.\n"},"reference/diagnostics.html":{"url":"reference/diagnostics.html","title":"Diagnostics","keywords":"","body":"Diagnostics\nIf Ambassador is not routing your services as you'd expect, your first step should be the Ambassador Diagnostics service.

The ELB is configured to route TCP to support both WebSockets and HTTP. Ambassador is configured with use_remote_address and use_proxy_proto to ensure that remote IP addresses are passed through properly. TLS termination then occurs at the ELB.\nAmbassador and AWS load balancer notes\nAWS provides three types of load balancers:\n\n\"Classic\" Load Balancer (abbreviated ELB or CLB, sometimes referred to as ELBv1 or Elastic Load Balancer)\nSupports L4 (TCP, TCP+SSL) and L7 load balancing (HTTP 1.1, HTTPS 1.1)\nDoes not support WebSockets unless running in L4 mode\nDoes not support HTTP 2 (which is required for GRPC) unless running in L4 mode\nCan perform SSL/TLS offload\n\n\nApplication Load Balancer (abbreviated ALB, sometimes referred to as ELBv2)\nSupports L7 only\nSupports WebSockets\nSupports a broken implementation of HTTP2 (trailers are not supported and these are needed for GRPC)\nCan perform SSL/TLS offload\n\n\nNetwork Load Balancer (abbreviated NLB)\nSupports L4 only\nCannot perform SSL/TLS offload\n\n\n\nIn Kubernetes, when using the AWS integration and a service of type LoadBalancer, the only types of load balancers that can be created are ELBs and NLBs (in Kubernetes 1.9 and later). When aws-load-balancer-backend-protocol is set to tcp, AWS will create a L4 ELB. When aws-load-balancer-backend-protocol is set to http, AWS will create a L7 ELB.\nL4 Load Balancer\nWhen running an ELB in L4 mode, you will need to listen on two ports to redirect all incoming HTTP requests to HTTPS. The first port will listen for HTTP traffic to redirect to HTTPS, while the second port will listen for HTTPS traffic.\nLet's say,\n\nport 80 on the load balancer forwards requests to port 8080 on Ambassador\nport 443 on the load balancer forwards requests to port 8443 on Ambassador\n\nFirst off, configure this forwarding in your load balancer.\nNow, we want every request on port 80 (8080 of Ambassador) to be redirected to port 443 (8443 of Ambassador)\nTo achieve this, you need to use redirect_cleartext_from as follows -\napiVersion: ambassador/v0\nkind:  Module\nname:  tls\nconfig:\n  server:\n    enabled: True\n    redirect_cleartext_from: 8080\n\nThis configuration makes Ambassador start a new listener on 8080 which redirects all cleartext HTTP traffic to HTTPS.\nNote: Ambassador only supports standard ports (80 and 443) on the load balancer for L4 redirection, yet! For instance, if you configure port 8888 for HTTP and 9999 for HTTPS on the load balancer, then an incoming request to http://:8888 will be redirected to https://:8888. This will fail because HTTPS listener is on port 9999.\nL7 Load Balancer\nIf you are running the load balancer in L7 mode, then you will want to redirect all the incoming HTTP requests without the X-FORWARDED-PROTO: https header to HTTPS. Here is an example Ambassador configuration for this scenario:\napiVersion: ambassador/v0\nkind: Module\nname: ambassador\nconfig:\n  x_forwarded_proto_redirect: true\n\n"},"reference/upgrading.html":{"url":"reference/upgrading.html","title":"Upgrading Ambassador","keywords":"","body":"Upgrading Ambassador\nSince Ambassador's configuration is entirely stored in annotations or a ConfigMap, no special process is necessary to upgrade Ambassador.

A key feature of Envoy is the observability it enables by exposing a multitude of statistics about its own operations. Ambassador makes it easy to direct this information to a statistics and monitoring tool of your choice.\nAs an example, for a given service usersvc, here are some interesting statistics to investigate:\n\nenvoy.cluster.usersvc_cluster.upstream_rq_total is the total number of requests that usersvc has received via Ambassador. The rate of change of this value is one basic measure of service utilization, i.e. requests per second.\nenvoy.cluster.usersvc_cluster.upstream_rq_2xx is the total number of requests to which usersvc responded with an HTTP response indicating success. This value divided by the prior one, taken on an rolling window basis, represents the recent success rate of the service. There are corresponding 4xx and 5xx counters that can help clarify the nature of unsuccessful requests.\nenvoy.cluster.usersvc_cluster.upstream_rq_time is a StatsD timer that tracks the latency in milliseconds of usersvc from Ambassador's perspective. StatsD timers include information about means, standard deviations, and decile values.\n\nExposing statistics via StatsD\nStatistics are exposed via the ubiquitous and well-tested StatsD protocol.\nTo expose statistics via StatsD, you will need to set an environment variable STATSD_ENABLED: true to Ambassador's Kubernetes Deployment YAML. To set this environment variable, run kubectl edit deployment ambassador and add the variable to spec.template.spec.containers[0].env.\nThe YAML snippet will look something like -\n\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - env:\n        - name: STATSD_ENABLED\n          value: \"true\"\n        - name: AMBASSADOR_NAMESPACE\n          valueFrom:\n            fieldRef:\n              apiVersion: v1\n              fieldPath: metadata.namespace\n        image: \n        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent\n\n\n Ambassador automatically sends statistics information to a Kubernetes service called statsd-sink using typical StatsD protocol settings, UDP to port 8125. We have included a few example configurations in the statsd-sink subdirectory to help you get started. Clone the repository to get local, editable copies.\n You may also override the StatsD host by setting the STATSD_HOST environment variable. This can be useful if you have an existing StatsD sink available in your cluster.\nGraphite\nGraphite is a web-based realtime graphing system. Spin up an example Graphite setup:\nkubectl apply -f statsd-sink/graphite/graphite-statsd-sink.yaml\nThis sets up the statsd-sink service and a deployment that contains Graphite and its related infrastructure. Graphite's web interface is available at http://statsd-sink/ from within the cluster. Use port forwarding to access the interface from your local machine:\nSINKPOD=$(kubectl get pod -l service=statsd-sink -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\")\nkubectl port-forward $SINKPOD 8080:80\nThis sets up Graphite access at http://localhost:8080/.\nPrometheus\nPrometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting system. If you use Prometheus, you should deploy a StatsD exporter as a sidecar on each of your Ambassador pods as shown in this example.\nThe statsd-sink service referenced in this example is built on the Prometheus StatsD Exporter, and configured in this Dockerfile.\nAdd a Prometheus target to read from statsd-sink on port 9102 to complete the Prometheus configuration.\nConfiguring metrics mappings for Prometheus\nIt may be desirable to change how metrics produced by the statsd-sink are named, labeled and grouped.\nFor example, by default each service that the API Gateway serves will create a new metric using its name. For the service called usersvc you will see this metric: envoy.cluster.usersvc_cluster.upstream_rq_total. This may lead to problems if you are trying to create a single aggregate that is the sum of all similar metrics from different services. In this case it is common to differentiate the metrics for an individual service with a label. This can be done using a mapping.\nFollow this guide to learn how to modify your mappings.\nConfiguring for Helm\nIf you deploy using helm the value that you should change is exporter.configuration. Set it to something like this:\nexporter:\n  configuration: |\n    ---\n    mappings:\n    - match: 'envoy.cluster.*.upstream_rq_total'\n      name: \"envoy_cluster_upstream_rq_total\"\n      timer_type: 'histogram'\n      labels:\n        cluster_name: \"$1\"\n\nConfiguring for kubectl\nIn the ambassador-rbac-prometheus example template there is a ConfigMap that should be updated. Add your mapping to the configuration property.\n---\napiVersion: v1\nkind: ConfigMap\nmetadata:\n  name: ambassador-config\ndata:\n  exporterConfiguration: |\n    ---\n    mappings:\n    - match: 'envoy.cluster.*.upstream_rq_total'\n      name: \"envoy_cluster_upstream_rq_total\"\n      timer_type: 'histogram'\n      labels:\n        cluster_name: \"$1\"\n\nThe Prometheus Operator\nIf you don't already have a Prometheus setup, the Prometheus operator is a powerful way to create and deploy Prometheus instances. Once you've installed and configured the Prometheus operator, the following files can be useful:\n\nstatsd-sink-svc.yaml creates a service that points to the sidecar statsd-sink on the Ambassador pod, and a ServiceMonitor that adds the statsd-sink as a Prometheus target\nprometheus.yaml creates a Prometheus object that collects data from the ServiceMonitor specified\nambassador-rbac-prometheus.yaml is an example Ambassador deployment that includes the Prometheus statsd exporter. The statsd exporter collects the stats data from Ambassador, translates it to Prometheus metrics, and is picked up by the Operator using the configurations above.\n\nMake sure that the ServiceMonitor is in the same namespace as Ambassador. A walk-through of the basics of configuring the Prometheus operator with Ambassador and Envoy is available here.\nStatsD as an Independent Deployment\nIf you want to set up the StatsD sink as an independent deployment, this example configuration mirrors the Graphite and Datadog configurations.\nGrafana\n\nIf you're using Grafana, Alex Gervais has written a template Grafana dashboard for Ambassador.\nDatadog\nIf you are a user of the Datadog monitoring system, pulling in Ambassador statistics is very easy. Replace the sample API key in the YAML file with your own, then launch the DogStatsD agent:\nkubectl apply -f statsd-sink/datadog/dd-statsd-sink.yaml\nThis sets up the statsd-sink service and a deployment of the DogStatsD agent that automatically forwards Ambassador stats to your Datadog account.\n"}}}
